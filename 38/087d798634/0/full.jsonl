Quick patches mask underlying issues.\n\n**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.\n\n**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**\n\n## The Iron Law\n\n```\nNO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST\n```\n\nIf you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.\n\n## When to Use\n\nUse for ANY technical issue:\n- Test failures\n- Bugs in production\n- Unexpected behavior\n- Performance problems\n- Build failures\n- Integration issues\n\n**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**\n- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)\n- \"Just one quick fix\" seems obvious\n- You've already tried multiple fixes\n- Previous fix didn't work\n- You don't fully understand the issue\n\n**Don't skip when:**\n- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)\n- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)\n- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)\n\n## The Four Phases\n\nYou MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.\n\n### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation\n\n**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**\n\n1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**\n   - Don't skip past errors or warnings\n   - They often contain the exact solution\n   - Read stack traces completely\n   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes\n\n2. **Reproduce Consistently**\n   - Can you trigger it reliably?\n   - What are the exact steps?\n   - Does it happen every time?\n   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess\n\n3. **Check Recent Changes**\n   - What changed that could cause this?\n   - Git diff, recent commits\n   - New dependencies, config changes\n   - Environmental differences\n\n4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**\n\n   **WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):**\n\n   **BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:**\n   ```\n   For EACH component boundary:\n     - Log what data enters component\n     - Log what data exits component\n     - Verify environment/config propagation\n     - Check state at each layer\n\n   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks\n   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component\n   THEN investigate that specific component\n   ```\n\n   **Example (multi-layer system):**\n   ```bash\n   # Layer 1: Workflow\n   echo \"=== Secrets available in workflow: ===\"\n   echo \"IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY:+SET}${IDENTITY:-UNSET}\"\n\n   # Layer 2: Build script\n   echo \"=== Env vars in build script: ===\"\n   env | grep IDENTITY || echo \"IDENTITY not in environment\"\n\n   # Layer 3: Signing script\n   echo \"=== Keychain state: ===\"\n   security list-keychains\n   security find-identity -v\n\n   # Layer 4: Actual signing\n   codesign --sign \"$IDENTITY\" --verbose=4 \"$APP\"\n   ```\n\n   **This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets → workflow ✓, workflow → build ✗)\n\n5. **Trace Data Flow**\n\n   **WHEN error is deep in call stack:**\n\n   See `root-cause-tracing.md` in this directory for the complete backward tracing technique.\n\n   **Quick version:**\n   - Where does bad value originate?\n   - What called this with bad value?\n   - Keep tracing up until you find the source\n   - Fix at source, not at symptom\n\n### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis\n\n**Find the pattern before fixing:**\n\n1. **Find Working Examples**\n   - Locate similar working code in same codebase\n   - What works that's similar to what's broken?\n\n2. **Compare Against References**\n   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY\n   - Don't skim - read every line\n   - Understand the pattern fully before applying\n\n3. **Identify Differences**\n   - What's different between working and broken?\n   - List every difference, however small\n   - Don't assume \"that can't matter\"\n\n4. **Understand Dependencies**\n   - What other components does this need?\n   - What settings, config, environment?\n   - What assumptions does it make?\n\n### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing\n\n**Scientific method:**\n\n1. **Form Single Hypothesis**\n   - State clearly: \"I think X is the root cause because Y\"\n   - Write it down\n   - Be specific, not vague\n\n2. **Test Minimally**\n   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis\n   - One variable at a time\n   - Don't fix multiple things at once\n\n3. **Verify Before Continuing**\n   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4\n   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis\n   - DON'T add more fixes on top\n\n4. **When You Don't Know**\n   - Say \"I don't understand X\"\n   - Don't pretend to know\n   - Ask for help\n   - Research more\n\n### Phase 4: Implementation\n\n**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**\n\n1. **Create Failing Test Case**\n   - Simplest possible reproduction\n   - Automated test if possible\n   - One-off test script if no framework\n   - MUST have before fixing\n   - Use the `superpowers:test-driven-development` skill for writing proper failing tests\n\n2. **Implement Single Fix**\n   - Address the root cause identified\n   - ONE change at a time\n   - No \"while I'm here\" improvements\n   - No bundled refactoring\n\n3. **Verify Fix**\n   - Test passes now?\n   - No other tests broken?\n   - Issue actually resolved?\n\n4. **If Fix Doesn't Work**\n   - STOP\n   - Count: How many fixes have you tried?\n   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information\n   - **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 5 below)**\n   - DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion\n\n5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**\n\n   **Pattern indicating architectural problem:**\n   - Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling/problem in different place\n   - Fixes require \"massive refactoring\" to implement\n   - Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere\n\n   **STOP and question fundamentals:**\n   - Is this pattern fundamentally sound?\n   - Are we \"sticking with it through sheer inertia\"?\n   - Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?\n\n   **Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes**\n\n   This is NOT a failed hypothesis - this is a wrong architecture.\n\n## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process\n\nIf you catch yourself thinking:\n- \"Quick fix for now, investigate later\"\n- \"Just try changing X and see if it works\"\n- \"Add multiple changes, run tests\"\n- \"Skip the test, I'll manually verify\"\n- \"It's probably X, let me fix that\"\n- \"I don't fully understand but this might work\"\n- \"Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently\"\n- \"Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]\"\n- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow\n- **\"One more fix attempt\" (when already tried 2+)**\n- **Each fix reveals new problem in different place**\n\n**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**\n\n**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (see Phase 4.5)\n\n## your human partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong\n\n**Watch for these redirections:**\n- \"Is that not happening?\" - You assumed without verifying\n- \"Will it show us...?\" - You should have added evidence gathering\n- \"Stop guessing\" - You're proposing fixes without understanding\n- \"Ultrathink this\" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms\n- \"We're stuck?\" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working\n\n**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.\n\n## Common Rationalizations\n\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Issue is simple, don't need process\" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |\n| \"Emergency, no time for process\" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |\n| \"Just try this first, then investigate\" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |\n| \"I'll write test after confirming fix works\" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |\n| \"Multiple fixes at once saves time\" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |\n| \"Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern\" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |\n| \"I see the problem, let me fix it\" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |\n| \"One more fix attempt\" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |\n|-------|---------------|------------------|\n| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |\n| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |\n| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |\n| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |\n\n## When Process Reveals \"No Root Cause\"\n\nIf systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:\n\n1. You've completed the process\n2. Document what you investigated\n3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)\n4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation\n\n**But:** 95% of \"no root cause\" cases are incomplete investigation.\n\n## Supporting Techniques\n\nThese techniques are part of systematic debugging and available in this directory:\n\n- **`root-cause-tracing.md`** - Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger\n- **`defense-in-depth.md`** - Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause\n- **`condition-based-waiting.md`** - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling\n\n**Related skills:**\n- **superpowers:test-driven-development** - For creating failing test case (Phase 4, Step 1)\n- **superpowers:verification-before-completion** - Verify fix worked before claiming success\n\n## Real-World Impact\n\nFrom debugging sessions:\n- Systematic approach: 15-30 minutes to fix\n- Random fixes approach: 2-3 hours of thrashing\n- First-time fix rate: 95% vs 40%\n- New bugs introduced: Near zero vs common\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"2574debe-f341-44c2-b3bc-5fc6fe169790","timestamp":"2026-02-22T10:55:31.274Z","sourceToolUseID":"toolu_0182WCkDLMJ7xK6BXB5v9j8C"}

You support people in their recovery journey by providing an interactive space to practice evidence-based skills, process difficult moments, and maintain awareness of their patterns.\n    13→\n    14→You are warm but direct. You care about the person you're talking with, and that care includes honesty—even when it's uncomfortable. You don't offer platitudes or toxic positivity. You meet people where they are while gently challenging them to examine their thinking.\n    15→\n    16→You are **not** a therapist, doctor, or replacement for professional treatment. You are a knowledgeable companion—think of yourself as a well-read friend who's always available, trained in the frameworks that support recovery, and genuinely invested in the person's wellbeing.\n    17→\n    18→## Philosophical Foundation\n    19→\n    20→RecoveryLM is built on the **Independent Recovery Framework (IRF)**, which integrates:\n    21→\n    22→- **SMART Recovery** principles: Self-empowerment, evidence-based techniques, cognitive-behavioral focus\n    23→- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Identifying automatic thoughts, cognitive distortions, and examining evidence\n    24→- **Stoic Philosophy**: The dichotomy of control, the impression-to-assent gap, building aversion toward reactive responses\n    25→- **Structured Accountability**: Support networks, leading indicators, external constraints built while clear-headed\n    26→\n    27→These frameworks converge on a central insight: **the problem isn't the impression, craving, or trigger—it's the unexamined assent.** Recovery involves building the capacity to notice mental events without automatically acting on them.\n    28→\n    29→## Understanding Vulnerability Patterns\n    30→\n    31→### The Craving Pattern\n    32→Some people struggle primarily with acute cravings—intense urges that demand immediate relief. For these users:\n    33→- Focus on urge surfing and distress tolerance\n    34→- The challenge is riding out the 30-60 minute wave\n    35→- Deploy DENTS protocol actively during acute episodes\n    36→- Remind them that urges peak and pass\n    37→\n    38→### The Rationalization Pattern\n    39→Others handle acute cravings well but are vulnerable to rationalization during stable periods. The danger isn't \"I desperately need this\"—it's persuasive internal arguments like:\n    40→- \"I've proven I can quit. I'm in control now.\"\n    41→- \"I've been so disciplined. I deserve this.\"\n    42→- \"I'll just use occasionally, not like before.\"\n    43→\n    44→For these users:\n    45→- Highest risk is when things are going *well*\n    46→- Watch for these thoughts and name them when they appear\n    47→- Use \"Play the Tape Through\" to counter the incomplete mental movie\n    48→- Be alert to \"seemingly irrelevant decisions\"\n    49→\n    50→## Core Tools and Techniques\n    51→\n    52→You have access to interactive widgets that render as UI elements in the chat. **You MUST include widget commands in your response** when appropriate—they will be automatically parsed and displayed as interactive tools.\n    53→\n    54→**CRITICAL**: When a user explicitly requests a tool (e.g., \"I need the DENTS protocol\", \"do my check-in\", \"urge surfing\"), you MUST include the corresponding widget command in your response. The command syntax is literal text you output—it gets parsed and replaced with an interactive widget.\n    55→\n    56→**When to include widgets:**\n    57→- User explicitly asks for a specific tool → ALWAYS include the widget\n    58→- User describes a craving or urge → Include W_DENTS or W_URGESURF\n    59→- User is rationalizing → Include W_TAPE\n    60→- User has a distorted thought → Include W_EVIDENCE\n    61→- User feels overwhelmed by circumstances → Include W_STOIC\n    62→\n    63→### DENTS Protocol (W_DENTS)\n    64→When someone is experiencing a craving, guide them through DENTS:\n    65→- **D**eny or Delay: Remind yourself the urge will pass\n    66→- **E**scape: Leave the trigger situation\n    67→- **N**eutralize: Challenge the internal monologue\n    68→- **T**asks: Redirect attention\n    69→- **S**wap: Change internal state\n    70→\n    71→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_DENTS|{\"trigger\":\"description\",\"intensity\":7}]\\`\n    72→\n    73→### Play the Tape Through (W_TAPE)\n    74→When rationalization begins, help trace the full chain of consequences.\n    75→\n    76→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_TAPE|{\"trigger\":\"description\",\"currentThought\":\"the thought\"}]\\`\n    77→\n    78→### CBT Evidence Examination (W_EVIDENCE)\n    79→Guide through examining cognitive distortions.\n    80→\n    81→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_EVIDENCE|{\"thought\":\"the thought\",\"distortion\":\"type\"}]\\`\n    82→\n    83→### Dichotomy of Control (W_STOIC)\n    84→Help distinguish between what's in their control and what isn't.\n    85→\n    86→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_STOIC|{\"situation\":\"description\"}]\\`\n    87→\n    88→### Urge Surfing (W_URGESURF)\n    89→Guided meditation for riding out urges.\n    90→\n    91→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_URGESURF|{\"duration\":300}]\\`\n    92→\n    93→### Daily Check-In (W_CHECKIN)\n    94→Track mood, habits, and sobriety for the day.\n    95→\n    96→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_CHECKIN|{}]\\`\n    97→\n    98→### Commitment Statement (W_COMMITMENT)\n    99→Review or edit the user's commitment statement.\n   100→\n   101→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_COMMITMENT|{\"mode\":\"view\"}]\\` or \\`[WIDGET:W_COMMITMENT|{\"mode\":\"edit\"}]\\`\n   102→\n   103→### Support Network (W_NETWORK)\n   104→View, contact, or edit support network.\n   105→\n   106→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_NETWORK|{\"action\":\"view\"}]\\` or \\`[WIDGET:W_NETWORK|{\"action\":\"notify\"}]\\`\n   107→\n   108→## Conversational Approach\n   109→\n   110→### Tone\n   111→- **Warm but direct**: You care, and that includes being honest\n   112→- **Conversational**: Write in prose, not bullet points.

Does it include user profile data (sobriety date, recovery stage)?\n\n2. **Orchestrator context building**: Read the orchestrator service (likely in `/src/services/`) - how does it build the context window for API calls? Does it load user profile, conversation history, daily metrics?\n\n3. **Chat initialization**: Read the `useChat` composable - what happens when a chat session starts? Does it load previous messages? Does it pass user context to the orchestrator?\n\n4. **User profile loading**: How is the user profile (including sobriety start date) loaded from the vault on app start? Is there a race condition where the chat could initialize before the profile is loaded?\n\n5. **Conversation history**: Does the orchestrator include previous conversation messages? Or does each session start fresh?\n\n6. **The greeting logic**: Is there specific logic that decides to show a \"welcome\" vs \"returning user\" greeting? Where does the \"Day 1\" calculation come from?\n\nFor each component, note what data is passed and what data might be MISSING that would cause Remi to think it's a new user on Day 1.

Let me compile the full analysis.\n\n---\n\nHere is the complete data flow trace and a precise identification of every place the context chain breaks.\n\n---\n\n## Complete Data Flow: Day 2 App Open to First Greeting\n\n### Step 1: App Startup and Vault Unlock\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/pages/UnlockPage.vue` (lines 28-51)\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/composables/useVault.ts` (lines 72-93)\n\nThe user enters their password. `vaultUnlock()` calls `vault.unlockVault()`, which derives the AES key from the password+salt and holds it in memory. After success, `userProfile.value = await vault.getProfile()` is called at line 81 of `useVault.ts` and stored in reactive state. The router then navigates to `dashboard`.\n\n**Key observation:** `userProfile` is loaded into the composable's reactive state at this point. This is the ONLY time `userProfile.value` is populated by `useVault`. There is no auto-refresh mechanism and no other trigger.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Navigation to Chat Page\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/router/index.ts` (lines 95-128)\n\nThe router guard runs `beforeEach`. For routes with `requiresOnboarding`, it calls `getProfile()` again to check `profile.onboardingComplete`. This is a fresh vault read, not using the reactive state. The user passes the guard and the `ChatPage` component mounts.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Chat Page `onMounted`\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/pages/ChatPage.vue` (lines 78-132)\n\nThis is the primary initialization sequence. No query params are present on a normal Day 2 open, so the code falls through to line 121:\n\n```javascript\nconst hasExistingMessages = await loadTodaySession()\n\nif (!hasExistingMessages) {\n  await generateGreeting()\n}\n```\n\n`loadTodaySession()` queries `getRecentSessions(10)` and looks for a session whose ID contains today's timestamp. On Day 2, yesterday's session has a different date embedded in its ID (format: `session_{timestamp}_{random}`). So `isSessionFromToday()` returns `false` for all existing sessions, `hasExistingMessages` is `false`, and `generateGreeting()` is called.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: `generateGreeting()` Executes\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/composables/useChat.ts` (lines 357-421)\n\n```javascript\nconst generateGreeting = async (): Promise<void> => {\n  if (messages.value.length > 0 || isGeneratingGreeting.value) {\n    return\n  }\n  isGeneratingGreeting.value = true\n  const context = await buildGreetingContext()   // <-- ENTIRE context built here\n  ...\n  await provider.streamMessage(context, { ... })\n}\n```\n\nThe greeting path uses `provider.streamMessage` (the NON-agentic path), NOT the agent runner. This means Remi gets NO tool access during the greeting. It cannot call `get_metrics` or `search_conversations` to look up the user's history. This is by design, but it means the greeting is entirely dependent on what `buildGreetingContext()` assembles.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: `buildGreetingContext()` - The Core of the Bug\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/orchestrator.ts` (lines 169-276)\n\nThis is where the critical logic lives. The function runs these in parallel:\n\n```javascript\nconst [profile, metrics, guidance, recentSessionIds, activityData, previousSession, supportNetwork] = await Promise.all([\n  vault.getProfile(),\n  vault.getMetrics({ limit: 7 }),\n  vault.getActiveGuidance(),\n  vault.getRecentSessions(5),\n  getActivityInsights(),\n  getPreviousSessionSummary(),\n  vault.getSupportNetwork()\n])\n```\n\nThe profile IS fetched directly from the vault here. So `profile.sobrietyStartDate` should be populated if it was set during onboarding. The temporal context is built correctly:\n\n```javascript\nconst temporalContext = buildTemporalContext(profile?.sobrietyStartDate, metrics, profile?.createdAt)\n```\n\n**Bug #1 - The `isFirstTime` flag is wrong on Day 2:**\n\n```javascript\n// Line 190:\nconst isFirstTime = !recentSessionIds.length || temporalContext.daysSinceSignup === 0\n```\n\n`recentSessionIds` comes from `vault.getRecentSessions(5)`. This function (`vault.ts` lines 410-433) queries `chatMessages` ordered by timestamp and extracts unique `sessionId` values. On Day 2, **if** yesterday's greeting message was saved, there ARE recent sessions, so `recentSessionIds.length > 0` and `isFirstTime` would be `false`.\n\n**However**, if the greeting message failed to save (e.g., the vault was locked during `onComplete`, or there was a race condition), `recentSessionIds` would be empty and `isFirstTime` would be `true`, triggering the first-time welcome message on every subsequent day.\n\n**Bug #2 - `daysSinceSignup === 0` can incorrectly make any day look like Day 1:**\n\n```javascript\n// Line 331-334 in anthropic.ts (buildSystemPrompt):\nif (daysSinceSignup <= 7) {\n  contextLines += `\\nNote: This user is new (${daysSinceSignup === 0 ? 'just signed up today' : ...})`\n}\n```\n\n`daysSinceSignup` is calculated from `profile?.createdAt`:\n\n```javascript\n// orchestrator.ts lines 124-127:\nlet daysSinceSignup = 0\nif (createdAt) {\n  const createdDate = new Date(createdAt).toISOString().split('T')[0]\n  daysSinceSignup = daysBetween(createdDate, today())\n}\n```\n\n**If `profile.createdAt` is undefined or `0`**, `daysSinceSignup` stays `0`, the condition `daysSinceSignup === 0` fires, and the system prompt tells Remi the user \"just signed up today\". `isFirstTime` also becomes `true` on line 190 via `temporalContext.daysSinceSignup === 0`.\n\nThe `UserProfile` type definition at `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/types/index.ts` line 16-25 shows `createdAt: number` is NOT optional in the type, but there is no runtime guarantee it is set during onboarding. If the onboarding flow saves the profile without a `createdAt` field, or sets it to `0`, this calculation collapses.\n\n**Bug #3 - `daysSober` is 0 when `sobrietyStartDate` is missing:**\n\n```javascript\n// orchestrator.ts lines 117-120:\nlet daysSober = 0\nif (sobrietyStartDate) {\n  daysSober = daysBetween(sobrietyStartDate, today())\n}\n```\n\n`sobrietyStartDate` is typed as `string | undefined` in `UserProfile`. If the onboarding step that sets this field was skipped, or the field name doesn't match exactly what was stored, `daysSober` stays `0`. The greeting instruction then sends:\n\n```\nDays sober: 0\n```\n\nAnd the system prompt section in `anthropic.ts` line 330 sends:\n\n```\n- Days sober: 0\n- Current streak: 0 days\n```\n\nThis is why Remi says \"Day 1\" - it's reading a literal `daysSober: 0` from the context.\n\n**Bug #4 - `recentConversation` is hardcoded to empty for greetings:**\n\n```javascript\n// orchestrator.ts line 269:\nrecentConversation: [],\n```\n\nThe greeting context explicitly passes an empty conversation history. This is intentional (it's a fresh session), but it means even if yesterday's chat was saved correctly, Remi cannot see it during greeting generation. The only mechanism for cross-session memory in the greeting is `previousSession` (the `SessionSummary` object), which is a structural summary (themes, emotional arc) not the actual transcript.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: System Prompt Construction\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/inference/anthropic.ts` (lines 308-477)\n\n`buildSystemPrompt()` assembles the final prompt sent to Claude. The `## Current Context` section at lines 329-334 is critical:\n\n```javascript\nlet contextLines = `## Current Context\\n- Local time: ${localTime}\\n- Days sober: ${daysSober}\\n- Current streak: ${currentStreak.days} days\\n- Days since signup: ${daysSinceSignup}`\nif (daysSinceSignup <= 7) {\n  contextLines += `\\nNote: This user is new (...)`\n}\n```\n\nIf `daysSober = 0` and `daysSinceSignup = 0`, Remi receives both \"Days sober: 0\" AND the explicit annotation \"This user is new (just signed up today)\". Combined with `isFirstTime = true` in the greeting instruction which tells Remi to \"Welcome them to the app and introduce yourself briefly\", this produces the first-time greeting even for a 70-day user.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: The Greeting Instruction Sent to Remi\n\nThe `currentMessage` field in the greeting context is not a user chat message - it's an internal instruction constructed at lines 235-259 of `orchestrator.ts`:\n\n```javascript\nconst greetingInstruction = `[INTERNAL INSTRUCTION - Generate a personalized greeting for ${displayName}]\n...\nUser type: ${isFirstTime ? 'First-time or brand new user - welcome them warmly' : 'Returning user'}\nDays sober: ${temporalContext.daysSober}\n...\n2. ${isFirstTime ? 'Welcomes them to the app and introduces yourself briefly' : 'Acknowledges they\\'re back'}`\n```\n\nWhen `isFirstTime` is `true` and `daysSober` is `0`, this instruction explicitly tells Remi to introduce itself and treat the user as brand new.\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Exactly Where the Chain Breaks\n\nThere are two independent failure points, either of which alone produces the bug:\n\n**Failure Point A - Missing or zero `createdAt` on the UserProfile.**\n\nLocation: `buildTemporalContext()` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/orchestrator.ts` lines 124-127.\n\nIf `profile.createdAt` is `0`, `undefined`, or missing from the stored object, `daysSinceSignup` is `0`. This triggers:\n1. `isFirstTime = true` (line 190, the `daysSinceSignup === 0` branch)\n2. The \"new user\" annotation in `buildSystemPrompt()` (line 332)\n3. The greeting instruction directs Remi to introduce itself as if first-time\n\n**Failure Point B - Missing `sobrietyStartDate` on the UserProfile.**\n\nLocation: `buildTemporalContext()` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/orchestrator.ts` lines 117-120.\n\nIf `profile.sobrietyStartDate` is not set (it's `string | undefined`), `daysSober` stays at `0`. The system prompt explicitly tells Remi \"Days sober: 0\" which causes the \"Day 1\" response even when `isFirstTime` is correct.\n\n**Failure Point C (secondary) - Session history lookup fails.**\n\nLocation: `buildGreetingContext()` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/orchestrator.ts` line 171/190.\n\n`vault.getRecentSessions(5)` finds previous sessions by querying `chatMessages`. If the greeting message from Day 1 was never persisted (vault was locked when `onComplete` fired in `useChat.ts` line 397), `recentSessionIds` is empty and `isFirstTime` becomes `true` even if `createdAt` and `daysSinceSignup` are correct.\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Fixes\n\n**Fix 1 - Guard `daysSinceSignup === 0` in `isFirstTime`:**\n\nIn `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/orchestrator.ts` line 190, change:\n\n```javascript\n// Current (broken):\nconst isFirstTime = !recentSessionIds.length || temporalContext.daysSinceSignup === 0\n\n// Fixed: only treat as first-time if BOTH no sessions AND signup was today\nconst isFirstTime = !recentSessionIds.length && temporalContext.daysSinceSignup <= 0\n```\n\n**Fix 2 - Ensure `createdAt` is always set during onboarding:**\n\nAudit the onboarding page (`/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/pages/OnboardingPage.vue`) to confirm that when `saveProfile()` is called, `createdAt: Date.now()` is always included. The type requires it but nothing enforces it at runtime.\n\n**Fix 3 - Ensure `sobrietyStartDate` is carried through onboarding:**\n\nThe user entered 70 days of sobriety during onboarding. Verify the onboarding flow is computing and saving `sobrietyStartDate` as a `YYYY-MM-DD` string. If the user entered a number of days rather than a date, that calculation must happen before `saveProfile()` is called.\n\n**Fix 4 - Separate the `isFirstTime` check from the `daysSinceSignup` calculation:**\n\nThe safest fix is to make `isFirstTime` purely based on session history, not on time calculations which are vulnerable to missing data:\n\n```javascript\n// In orchestrator.ts:\nconst hasAnySessions = recentSessionIds.length > 0\nconst isFirstTime = !hasAnySessions\n```\n\nIf there are previous sessions, the user has been here before - period.\n\n---\n\n## Essential Files\n\n| File | Role in the Bug |\n|---|---|\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/orchestrator.ts` | Lines 169-276: `buildGreetingContext()` assembles all context; lines 103-163: `buildTemporalContext()` computes `daysSober` and `daysSinceSignup`; line 190: the broken `isFirstTime` logic |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/inference/anthropic.ts` | Lines 308-477: `buildSystemPrompt()` formats context into what Claude receives; line 329-334: where \"Days sober: 0\" and the \"new user\" note are injected |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/composables/useChat.ts` | Lines 357-421: `generateGreeting()` is the entry point; calls `buildGreetingContext()` then `streamMessage()` directly (no agent loop, no tools) |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/types/index.ts` | Lines 14-25: `UserProfile` type shows `sobrietyStartDate` is optional and `createdAt` has no default enforcement |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/pages/ChatPage.vue` | Lines 78-132: `onMounted` sequence determines when `loadTodaySession` vs `generateGreeting` is called |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/composables/useVault.ts` | Lines 72-93: `unlock()` is where `userProfile` reactive state is populated after Day 2 login |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/prompts/remmi.ts` | Lines 169-212: System prompt states Remi has NO persistent memory and must use tools - but the greeting path bypasses the agent/tools entirely |"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a0edd35ea4717e0a8 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 79597\ntool_uses: 15\nduration_ms: 102481</usage>"}]}]},"uuid":"c1dc2e08-7f00-4f8b-b759-9d87ecb91b9c","timestamp":"2026-02-22T10:57:28.239Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I'm debugging a bug where Remi (AI companion) loses user context between sessions.

Is there a race condition where the chat could initialize before the profile is loaded?\n\n5. **Conversation history**: Does the orchestrator include previous conversation messages?

Let me compile the full analysis.\n\n---\n\nHere is the complete data flow trace and a precise identification of every place the context chain breaks.\n\n---\n\n## Complete Data Flow: Day 2 App Open to First Greeting\n\n### Step 1: App Startup and Vault Unlock\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/pages/UnlockPage.vue` (lines 28-51)\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/composables/useVault.ts` (lines 72-93)\n\nThe user enters their password. `vaultUnlock()` calls `vault.unlockVault()`, which derives the AES key from the password+salt and holds it in memory. After success, `userProfile.value = await vault.getProfile()` is called at line 81 of `useVault.ts` and stored in reactive state. The router then navigates to `dashboard`.\n\n**Key observation:** `userProfile` is loaded into the composable's reactive state at this point. This is the ONLY time `userProfile.value` is populated by `useVault`. There is no auto-refresh mechanism and no other trigger.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Navigation to Chat Page\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/router/index.ts` (lines 95-128)\n\nThe router guard runs `beforeEach`. For routes with `requiresOnboarding`, it calls `getProfile()` again to check `profile.onboardingComplete`. This is a fresh vault read, not using the reactive state. The user passes the guard and the `ChatPage` component mounts.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Chat Page `onMounted`\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/pages/ChatPage.vue` (lines 78-132)\n\nThis is the primary initialization sequence. No query params are present on a normal Day 2 open, so the code falls through to line 121:\n\n```javascript\nconst hasExistingMessages = await loadTodaySession()\n\nif (!hasExistingMessages) {\n  await generateGreeting()\n}\n```\n\n`loadTodaySession()` queries `getRecentSessions(10)` and looks for a session whose ID contains today's timestamp. On Day 2, yesterday's session has a different date embedded in its ID (format: `session_{timestamp}_{random}`). So `isSessionFromToday()` returns `false` for all existing sessions, `hasExistingMessages` is `false`, and `generateGreeting()` is called.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: `generateGreeting()` Executes\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/composables/useChat.ts` (lines 357-421)\n\n```javascript\nconst generateGreeting = async (): Promise<void> => {\n  if (messages.value.length > 0 || isGeneratingGreeting.value) {\n    return\n  }\n  isGeneratingGreeting.value = true\n  const context = await buildGreetingContext()   // <-- ENTIRE context built here\n  ...\n  await provider.streamMessage(context, { ... })\n}\n```\n\nThe greeting path uses `provider.streamMessage` (the NON-agentic path), NOT the agent runner. This means Remi gets NO tool access during the greeting. It cannot call `get_metrics` or `search_conversations` to look up the user's history. This is by design, but it means the greeting is entirely dependent on what `buildGreetingContext()` assembles.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: `buildGreetingContext()` - The Core of the Bug\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/orchestrator.ts` (lines 169-276)\n\nThis is where the critical logic lives. The function runs these in parallel:\n\n```javascript\nconst [profile, metrics, guidance, recentSessionIds, activityData, previousSession, supportNetwork] = await Promise.all([\n  vault.getProfile(),\n  vault.getMetrics({ limit: 7 }),\n  vault.getActiveGuidance(),\n  vault.getRecentSessions(5),\n  getActivityInsights(),\n  getPreviousSessionSummary(),\n  vault.getSupportNetwork()\n])\n```\n\nThe profile IS fetched directly from the vault here. So `profile.sobrietyStartDate` should be populated if it was set during onboarding. The temporal context is built correctly:\n\n```javascript\nconst temporalContext = buildTemporalContext(profile?.sobrietyStartDate, metrics, profile?.createdAt)\n```\n\n**Bug #1 - The `isFirstTime` flag is wrong on Day 2:**\n\n```javascript\n// Line 190:\nconst isFirstTime = !recentSessionIds.length || temporalContext.daysSinceSignup === 0\n```\n\n`recentSessionIds` comes from `vault.getRecentSessions(5)`. This function (`vault.ts` lines 410-433) queries `chatMessages` ordered by timestamp and extracts unique `sessionId` values. On Day 2, **if** yesterday's greeting message was saved, there ARE recent sessions, so `recentSessionIds.length > 0` and `isFirstTime` would be `false`.\n\n**However**, if the greeting message failed to save (e.g., the vault was locked during `onComplete`, or there was a race condition), `recentSessionIds` would be empty and `isFirstTime` would be `true`, triggering the first-time welcome message on every subsequent day.\n\n**Bug #2 - `daysSinceSignup === 0` can incorrectly make any day look like Day 1:**\n\n```javascript\n// Line 331-334 in anthropic.ts (buildSystemPrompt):\nif (daysSinceSignup <= 7) {\n  contextLines += `\\nNote: This user is new (${daysSinceSignup === 0 ? 'just signed up today' : ...})`\n}\n```\n\n`daysSinceSignup` is calculated from `profile?.createdAt`:\n\n```javascript\n// orchestrator.ts lines 124-127:\nlet daysSinceSignup = 0\nif (createdAt) {\n  const createdDate = new Date(createdAt).toISOString().split('T')[0]\n  daysSinceSignup = daysBetween(createdDate, today())\n}\n```\n\n**If `profile.createdAt` is undefined or `0`**, `daysSinceSignup` stays `0`, the condition `daysSinceSignup === 0` fires, and the system prompt tells Remi the user \"just signed up today\". `isFirstTime` also becomes `true` on line 190 via `temporalContext.daysSinceSignup === 0`.\n\nThe `UserProfile` type definition at `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/types/index.ts` line 16-25 shows `createdAt: number` is NOT optional in the type, but there is no runtime guarantee it is set during onboarding. If the onboarding flow saves the profile without a `createdAt` field, or sets it to `0`, this calculation collapses.\n\n**Bug #3 - `daysSober` is 0 when `sobrietyStartDate` is missing:**\n\n```javascript\n// orchestrator.ts lines 117-120:\nlet daysSober = 0\nif (sobrietyStartDate) {\n  daysSober = daysBetween(sobrietyStartDate, today())\n}\n```\n\n`sobrietyStartDate` is typed as `string | undefined` in `UserProfile`. If the onboarding step that sets this field was skipped, or the field name doesn't match exactly what was stored, `daysSober` stays `0`. The greeting instruction then sends:\n\n```\nDays sober: 0\n```\n\nAnd the system prompt section in `anthropic.ts` line 330 sends:\n\n```\n- Days sober: 0\n- Current streak: 0 days\n```\n\nThis is why Remi says \"Day 1\" - it's reading a literal `daysSober: 0` from the context.\n\n**Bug #4 - `recentConversation` is hardcoded to empty for greetings:**\n\n```javascript\n// orchestrator.ts line 269:\nrecentConversation: [],\n```\n\nThe greeting context explicitly passes an empty conversation history.

It hardcodes `sobrietyStartDate` to today's date. So on Day 1, `daysSober = 0`. On Day 2, `daysSober = 1`. The user's reported 70 days is completely ignored.\n\n### Root Cause 2: `isFirstTime` uses `||` instead of `&&` (Secondary)\n**File:** `src/services/orchestrator.ts:190`\n\n```typescript\nconst isFirstTime = !recentSessionIds.length || temporalContext.daysSinceSignup === 0\n```\n\nThis means `isFirstTime = true` if **either** condition is true. On Day 2, even though `recentSessionIds` has yesterday's session, if `daysSinceSignup === 0` (which can't happen here since `createdAt` is set), it would still trigger. More importantly, if the Day 1 greeting message wasn't persisted for any reason, `!recentSessionIds.length` alone makes it first-time, regardless of the user having signed up yesterday.\n\nThe `||` should be `&&` — only treat as first-time if there are no sessions **and** the signup was today.\n\n### Why the user sees \"Day 1\" on Day 2\n\n1. `sobrietyStartDate = today()` was saved during onboarding on Day 1\n2. On Day 2, `daysBetween(dayOneDate, dayTwoDate) = 1`, so Remi says \"Day 1\" (1 day sober, not 71)\n3. The greeting instruction sends `Days sober: 1` instead of `Days sober: 71`\n4. The `isFirstTime` flag may also fire if yesterday's session wasn't saved\n\nWant me to fix both issues? The fix involves:\n1. Adding a sobriety date/duration input to the onboarding flow\n2.

Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.\n\n<HARD-GATE>\nDo NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.\n</HARD-GATE>\n\n## Anti-Pattern: \"This Is Too Simple To Need A Design\"\n\nEvery project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. \"Simple\" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.\n\n## Checklist\n\nYou MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:\n\n1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits\n2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria\n3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation\n4. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section\n5. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` and commit\n6. **Transition to implementation** — invoke writing-plans skill to create implementation plan\n\n## Process Flow\n\n```dot\ndigraph brainstorming {\n    \"Explore project context\" [shape=box];\n    \"Ask clarifying questions\" [shape=box];\n    \"Propose 2-3 approaches\" [shape=box];\n    \"Present design sections\" [shape=box];\n    \"User approves design?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Write design doc\" [shape=box];\n    \"Invoke writing-plans skill\" [shape=doublecircle];\n\n    \"Explore project context\" -> \"Ask clarifying questions\";\n    \"Ask clarifying questions\" -> \"Propose 2-3 approaches\";\n    \"Propose 2-3 approaches\" -> \"Present design sections\";\n    \"Present design sections\" -> \"User approves design?\";\n    \"User approves design?\" -> \"Present design sections\" [label=\"no, revise\"];\n    \"User approves design?\" -> \"Write design doc\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Write design doc\" -> \"Invoke writing-plans skill\";\n}\n```\n\n**The terminal state is invoking writing-plans.** Do NOT invoke frontend-design, mcp-builder, or any other implementation skill. The ONLY skill you invoke after brainstorming is writing-plans.\n\n## The Process\n\n**Understanding the idea:**\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\n\n**Exploring approaches:**\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\n\n**Presenting the design:**\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\n- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\n\n## After the Design\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\n- Commit the design document to git\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan\n- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions\n- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible\n- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs\n- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling\n- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on\n- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"c5a999db-6178-4879-80c5-6461f1a5612a","timestamp":"2026-02-22T10:59:19.637Z","sourceToolUseID":"toolu_01VcUtWSzr9GLYmTjv43L3J2"}

Here's a summary:\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### Fix 1: Collect sobriety duration during onboarding\n**`src/pages/OnboardingPage.vue`** — After the user selects their recovery stage (early/established/long-term), a follow-up input asks \"About how many days have you been sober?\" Users selecting \"Considering\" skip this (defaulting to 0 days).\n\n### Fix 2: Compute `sobrietyStartDate` from user input\n**`src/pages/OnboardingPage.vue:62`** — Changed from `sobrietyStartDate: today()` (hardcoded) to `sobrietyStartDate: computeSobrietyStartDate()` which subtracts the user's reported days from today's date. A user reporting 70 days gets a date 70 days in the past.\n\n### Fix 3: Fix `isFirstTime` logic\n**`src/services/orchestrator.ts:190`** — Changed `||` to `&&`. Now a user is only treated as first-time if **both** there are no previous sessions **and** they signed up today. Previously, either condition alone would trigger the first-time greeting.\n\nTypecheck passes clean.

Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.\n\n<HARD-GATE>\nDo NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.\n</HARD-GATE>\n\n## Anti-Pattern: \"This Is Too Simple To Need A Design\"\n\nEvery project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. \"Simple\" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.\n\n## Checklist\n\nYou MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:\n\n1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits\n2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria\n3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation\n4. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section\n5. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` and commit\n6. **Transition to implementation** — invoke writing-plans skill to create implementation plan\n\n## Process Flow\n\n```dot\ndigraph brainstorming {\n    \"Explore project context\" [shape=box];\n    \"Ask clarifying questions\" [shape=box];\n    \"Propose 2-3 approaches\" [shape=box];\n    \"Present design sections\" [shape=box];\n    \"User approves design?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Write design doc\" [shape=box];\n    \"Invoke writing-plans skill\" [shape=doublecircle];\n\n    \"Explore project context\" -> \"Ask clarifying questions\";\n    \"Ask clarifying questions\" -> \"Propose 2-3 approaches\";\n    \"Propose 2-3 approaches\" -> \"Present design sections\";\n    \"Present design sections\" -> \"User approves design?\";\n    \"User approves design?\" -> \"Present design sections\" [label=\"no, revise\"];\n    \"User approves design?\" -> \"Write design doc\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Write design doc\" -> \"Invoke writing-plans skill\";\n}\n```\n\n**The terminal state is invoking writing-plans.** Do NOT invoke frontend-design, mcp-builder, or any other implementation skill. The ONLY skill you invoke after brainstorming is writing-plans.\n\n## The Process\n\n**Understanding the idea:**\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\n\n**Exploring approaches:**\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\n\n**Presenting the design:**\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\n- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\n\n## After the Design\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\n- Commit the design document to git\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan\n- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions\n- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible\n- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs\n- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling\n- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on\n- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"c93a0ead-05dc-4cba-a035-4a997befc314","timestamp":"2026-02-22T11:05:53.896Z","sourceToolUseID":"toolu_016djpKVmhLJKgv6cSLJ1HP9"}

You support people in their recovery journey by providing an interactive space to practice evidence-based skills, process difficult moments, and maintain awareness of their patterns.\n    13→\n    14→You are warm but direct. You care about the person you're talking with, and that care includes honesty—even when it's uncomfortable. You don't offer platitudes or toxic positivity. You meet people where they are while gently challenging them to examine their thinking.\n    15→\n    16→You are **not** a therapist, doctor, or replacement for professional treatment. You are a knowledgeable companion—think of yourself as a well-read friend who's always available, trained in the frameworks that support recovery, and genuinely invested in the person's wellbeing.\n    17→\n    18→## Philosophical Foundation\n    19→\n    20→RecoveryLM is built on the **Independent Recovery Framework (IRF)**, which integrates:\n    21→\n    22→- **SMART Recovery** principles: Self-empowerment, evidence-based techniques, cognitive-behavioral focus\n    23→- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Identifying automatic thoughts, cognitive distortions, and examining evidence\n    24→- **Stoic Philosophy**: The dichotomy of control, the impression-to-assent gap, building aversion toward reactive responses\n    25→- **Structured Accountability**: Support networks, leading indicators, external constraints built while clear-headed\n    26→\n    27→These frameworks converge on a central insight: **the problem isn't the impression, craving, or trigger—it's the unexamined assent.** Recovery involves building the capacity to notice mental events without automatically acting on them.\n    28→\n    29→## Understanding Vulnerability Patterns\n    30→\n    31→### The Craving Pattern\n    32→Some people struggle primarily with acute cravings—intense urges that demand immediate relief. For these users:\n    33→- Focus on urge surfing and distress tolerance\n    34→- The challenge is riding out the 30-60 minute wave\n    35→- Deploy DENTS protocol actively during acute episodes\n    36→- Remind them that urges peak and pass\n    37→\n    38→### The Rationalization Pattern\n    39→Others handle acute cravings well but are vulnerable to rationalization during stable periods. The danger isn't \"I desperately need this\"—it's persuasive internal arguments like:\n    40→- \"I've proven I can quit. I'm in control now.\"\n    41→- \"I've been so disciplined. I deserve this.\"\n    42→- \"I'll just use occasionally, not like before.\"\n    43→\n    44→For these users:\n    45→- Highest risk is when things are going *well*\n    46→- Watch for these thoughts and name them when they appear\n    47→- Use \"Play the Tape Through\" to counter the incomplete mental movie\n    48→- Be alert to \"seemingly irrelevant decisions\"\n    49→\n    50→## Core Tools and Techniques\n    51→\n    52→You have access to interactive widgets that render as UI elements in the chat. **You MUST include widget commands in your response** when appropriate—they will be automatically parsed and displayed as interactive tools.\n    53→\n    54→**CRITICAL**: When a user explicitly requests a tool (e.g., \"I need the DENTS protocol\", \"do my check-in\", \"urge surfing\"), you MUST include the corresponding widget command in your response.

Let me compile the complete analysis.\n\n---\n\n# Complete Memory and Context System Analysis for Remi\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nRemi's awareness of the user is assembled from two distinct pipelines depending on where in the flow a request originates:\n\n1. **Greeting pipeline** (`buildGreetingContext`) — fires once when the user opens the app to generate the opening message. Uses the most context sources.\n2. **Chat pipeline** (`buildContextWindow` + `runAgent`) — fires for every user message. Adds the agent tool loop on top.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Context Sources for `buildContextWindow()` and `buildGreetingContext()`\n\nBoth functions in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/orchestrator.ts` fetch data in parallel and assemble a `ContextWindow` object that `buildSystemPrompt()` serializes into sections appended to Remi's base system prompt.\n\n### Sources fetched by `buildContextWindow()` (lines 287-296)\n\n| Source | Vault call | What it provides |\n|---|---|---|\n| `UserProfile` | `vault.getProfile()` | Name, commitment statement, vulnerability pattern, substances, sobriety start date |\n| `DailyMetric[]` | `vault.getMetrics({ limit: 7 })` | Last 7 days of habit booleans, mood scores, craving intensity, sleep, anxiety |\n| `TherapistGuidance[]` | `vault.getActiveGuidance()` | Active therapist notes injected verbatim |\n| `ChatMessage[]` (current session) | `vault.getChatHistory(currentSessionId)` | Full in-session conversation replay (up to 50 messages) |\n| `SessionSummary[]` (2 previous) | `getRecentSessionSummaries(2)` | Summarized themes/arc for the 2 most recent non-today sessions |\n| `SupportNetwork` | `vault.getSupportNetwork()` | Tier 1/Tier 2 support people with roles |\n| `ActivityInsightsResult` | `getActivityInsights()` | Per-widget completion counts, last-used timestamps, suggested activities, practice gaps |\n| `MemoryItem[]` (keyword search) | `searchRelevantHistory(currentMessage, sessionId)` | Up to 16 journal entries + past chat messages scored by keyword/theme match |\n\n`buildGreetingContext()` is a superset: it also calls `getPreviousSessionSummary()` (the single most recent non-today session with full emotional arc and unresolved-concern notes) and composes a detailed greeting instruction as the `currentMessage` field. It does **not** call `searchRelevantHistory` because no user message exists yet.\n\n### How it becomes the system prompt\n\n`buildSystemPrompt()` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/inference/anthropic.ts` (lines 308-477) appends all context as labeled Markdown sections after the base `REMMI_SYSTEM_PROMPT`:\n\n```\n## User's Commitment Statement\n## Vulnerability Pattern\n## Substance(s) of Focus\n## Current Context          (temporal: time, days sober, streak, new-user note)\n## Active Therapist Guidance\n## Leading Indicators (Risk Signals)\n## Recent Metrics (last 7 days)\n## Activity Usage\n## Recent Session History    (last 2 sessions, compact format)\n## Relevant History          (memory search results)\n## Support Network\n## Safety Note               (crisis context, if any)\n```\n\nThe recent conversation goes into the `messages[]` array (not the system prompt) — up to 50 messages in the Anthropic API call.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Memory Search Service\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memorySearch.ts`\n\nThis is a client-side, keyword-extraction + theme-matching search. It is called once per user message via `searchRelevantHistory(currentMessage, currentSessionId)` (orchestrator line 295).\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Keyword extraction** — strips stop words from the current message, keeps tokens 3+ chars. A 200-word stop list is hardcoded.\n2. **Theme detection** — 11 hardcoded theme buckets (`craving`, `stress`, `relationships`, `work`, `emotions`, `progress`, `relapse`, `sleep`, `health`, `gratitude`, `trigger`). Each bucket is a list of exact-match keywords.\n3. **Data fetch** — pulls two sources in parallel:\n   - Journal entries from the last 60 days (`JOURNAL_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 60`), `entryType === 'user'` only.\n   - User messages from up to 5 past sessions (`MAX_PAST_SESSIONS = 5`), assistant messages excluded.\n4. **Scoring** — each candidate gets +1 per keyword match, +0.5 per theme word match. No semantic understanding.\n5. **Deduplication** — exact prefix dedup on first 80 chars.\n6. **Output** — top 16 entries (`MAX_ENTRIES`), each truncated to ~600 chars. Total budget: 2400 tokens.\n\n### What it does well\n- Retrieves genuinely related past content when the current message shares concrete vocabulary with past entries.\n- Has a sensible token budget.\n\n### What it misses\n- No semantic similarity. \"I'm struggling\" won't match \"I'm having a hard time.\"\n- Only searches 5 past sessions and 60 days of journal. Long-term users lose older context entirely.\n- Only indexes `user` messages from chat and `user`-type journal entries — Remi's own past responses (which contain the widget params Remi chose) are not searched.\n- No weighting for recency within the score — a 58-day-old entry with 3 keyword hits outranks a 2-day-old entry with 2 hits.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Session Summaries\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/sessionSummarizer.ts`\n\nSummaries are computed on-demand by re-reading raw chat messages from the vault each time — they are **not persisted**. Every call to `getRecentSessionSummaries(2)` or `getPreviousSessionSummary()` re-decrypts and re-analyzes the last N sessions from scratch.\n\n### `SessionSummary` type (from `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/types/index.ts`, lines 611-620)\n\n```typescript\ninterface SessionSummary {\n  sessionId: string\n  date: string\n  themes: string[]          // keyword-matched from the same THEME_KEYWORDS dict\n  emotionalArc: EmotionalArc // 'improving' | 'stable' | 'declining' | 'crisis-managed' | 'unknown'\n  widgetsUsed: WidgetId[]\n  endState: SessionEndState  // 'resolved' | 'unresolved' | 'open-ended'\n  userIntentions?: string[]  // regex-matched phrases like \"I'll try to...\"\n  messageCount: number\n}\n```\n\n### How `emotionalArc` is determined (lines 74-110)\n\n- If any message has `crisisLevel` of `emergency` or `urgent`, it's a crisis session. If the last third of messages have no crisis level, it returns `crisis-managed`; otherwise `declining`.\n- Otherwise: compares positive/negative keyword counts in the first half vs second half of user messages. Threshold is ±1 net score difference.\n\n### How `endState` is determined (lines 132-156)\n\nKeyword matching on the last 1-2 user messages:\n- `resolved` if \"thank\", \"helped\", \"better now\", \"bye\", etc. appear.\n- `unresolved` if \"still\", \"not sure\", \"don't know\", \"scared\", etc. appear.\n- `open-ended` otherwise.\n\n### How `userIntentions` are extracted (lines 161-180)\n\nRegex patterns: `I'll`, `I will`, `I want to`, `I need to`, `my goal is to`, `I'm going to try`. Capped at 3 results.\n\n### What persists between sessions\n\nSession summaries provide Remi with:\n- Themes from the last 2 sessions.\n- Whether the previous session ended unresolved (triggers a check-in instruction in the greeting/chat context).\n- Whether the user was emotionally declining (triggers \"be extra supportive\" note).\n- Widgets used.\n- Stated intentions (rough follow-up potential).\n\n### Critical gap\n\nSummaries are computed fresh every time and not persisted. For a user with 100 sessions, computing 2 summaries means loading and decrypting 2×N messages. No summary data ever accumulates into a longer-term user model.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Vault Storage — Full Inventory\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/vault.ts`\n\nAll data is AES-GCM-256 encrypted via PBKDF2-derived key. The key lives only in memory (`getCurrentKey()`). The vault's IndexedDB schema (Dexie) stores these tables:\n\n| Table | Data model | Used for Remi? |\n|---|---|---|\n| `userProfile` | `UserProfile` | Yes — commitment statement, vulnerability pattern, substances, sobriety start, name |\n| `emergencyContacts` | `EmergencyContact` | Not injected into Remi context currently |\n| `supportNetwork` | `SupportPerson` (tier 1/2) | Yes — full network with names and roles |\n| `dailyMetrics` | `DailyMetric` (keyed by date) | Yes — last 7 days of habits, mood, sleep, anxiety, cravings |\n| `journalEntries` | `JournalEntry` | Yes — searched by `memorySearch` (60-day window, user entries only) |\n| `chatMessages` | `ChatMessage` (with widgets) | Yes — current session via `getChatHistory`, past 5 sessions via `searchRelevantHistory` |\n| `therapistGuidance` | `TherapistGuidance` | Yes — active items only |\n| `metricsConfig` | `MetricsConfig` | No — user's metric customization, not in context |\n| `activityLogs` | `ActivityLog` (with `result`) | Partially — only completion counts and last-used times via `activityInsights` |\n| `dailyPracticeConfig` | `DailyPracticeConfig` | Yes — which activities are enabled, for `activityInsights` |\n| `settings` | `AppSettings` | No |\n\n### Notably unused vault data\n\n- `activityLog.result` — the structured outcome of each widget (e.g. what triggers, intensity, and steps the user went through in a DENTS session) is stored but never surfaced to Remi.\n- `emergencyContact` — not passed to Remi despite the support network being passed.\n- `metricsConfig` — Remi doesn't know which custom metrics the user has configured.\n- `DailyMetric.notes` — free-text notes on each day's check-in are in the type definition but not explicitly formatted in the metrics section of the system prompt (though they would appear if `analyze_trends` returns them via `get_metrics` tool).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Agent Tools — Available During Normal Chat\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/agentTools.ts` (definitions)\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/agent/runner.ts` (execution)\n\nThe agent loop (`runAgent`) is always active during normal chat. Every `sendMessage()` call goes through `runAgent` (useChat.ts, lines 160-183). The agent has three tools available:\n\n### `search_conversations`\n- Searches up to 20 recent sessions by keyword (content match + widget ID match via `WIDGET_SEARCH_TERMS`).\n- Date range filtering on session ID timestamp.\n- Returns: session date, message count, preview of first user message, up to 5 matching messages (truncated to 300 chars each).\n- Supports widget-aware search: \"dichotomy of control\" → finds W_STOIC completions.\n\n### `get_metrics`\n- Returns daily metrics with optional trend analysis.\n- Can go back arbitrarily far with `after_date`.\n- Trend analysis: avg mood, mood trend direction, sobriety streak, exercise/meditation days, craving frequency.\n- Does not return `DailyMetric.notes`.\n\n### `search_journal`\n- Filters by tags: `craving`, `rationalization`, `trigger`, `gratitude`, `relapse`, `victory`, `therapy-prep`, `urge-surfed`, `distortion-caught`.\n- Returns entry content (truncated to 500 chars), tags, sentiment.\n- No keyword search — only tag-based filtering.\n\n### When tools are actually invoked\n\nThe system prompt (`remmi.ts`, lines 169-210) instructs Remi to call tools when the user references past history. The agentic loop runs up to `MAX_AGENT_ITERATIONS = 5` (useChat.ts line 16). Tools are NOT automatically called — they require Remi to proactively decide to use them. The pre-assembled context from `buildContextWindow` already provides the most recent 7 days of metrics and 2 session summaries, so Remi may not always feel the need to call tools even when historical data would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n## 6. System Prompt — What Remi Is Told About Memory\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/prompts/remmi.ts` (lines 169-210)\n\nThe `## CRITICAL: Memory and Tools` section explicitly tells Remi:\n\n> \"You have NO persistent memory. Each conversation starts fresh. You cannot recall what the user said yesterday, last week, or in previous sessions. The context window only contains the current session's messages.\"\n\nAnd:\n\n> \"To access ANY historical information, you MUST use the search tools. This is not optional.\"\n\nThis is aspirationally correct — Remi must use tools for anything older than what's in the injected context. However, the injected context already contains 7 days of metrics, 2 session summaries, and a memory search of the last 60 days of journal/5 sessions. So in practice Remi has substantial passive context without calling any tools. The instruction to \"always use tools\" is somewhat in tension with the rich pre-built context.\n\n---\n\n## 7. The Gaps — What Remi Does NOT Have\n\n### Gap 1: No persistent user model / long-term memory store\n\nThere is no \"user model\" document or fact store that accumulates across sessions. Things like:\n- \"User mentioned their father as a main trigger in April\"\n- \"User prefers CBT over Stoic exercises\"\n- \"User has relapsed twice, both times on Friday evenings after work stress\"\n- \"User explicitly asked Remi to follow up on their therapy appointment\"\n\nThese exist only as raw messages. To find them, Remi must call `search_conversations` with exactly the right keyword, which it often won't know to do.\n\n### Gap 2: `activityLog.result` is never surfaced\n\nEvery widget completion stores a structured `result` in the `ActivityLog`. For example, a DENTS session presumably stores the trigger, intensity, and which steps the user completed. This outcome data is completely invisible to Remi. `activityInsights` only exposes counts and timestamps, not what actually happened inside each exercise.\n\n### Gap 3: Session summaries are re-computed and only cover 2 sessions\n\nRemi can only see the last 2 session summaries in normal chat. For a user with months of history, sessions 3-100 are completely invisible unless Remi explicitly searches. The summaries are also recomputed every time (no caching or persistence), and they're shallow (keyword matching, not semantic understanding of what the user was actually working through).\n\n### Gap 4: `search_journal` has no keyword search\n\nJournal entries can only be found by their pre-assigned tags. If the user journaled about \"my brother's wedding making me want to drink\" but it was tagged as `craving` and the user is now asking about \"family pressure\", Remi can find it by tag but has no way to do a semantic search. Keywords within journal content are only searchable via `memorySearch.ts` — but that's already run automatically and only covers 60 days.\n\n### Gap 5: Emotional pattern data is not aggregated\n\nRemi gets a 7-day mood snapshot and the emotional arc of 2 sessions. There is no aggregated view of:\n- Long-term mood trend (30/60/90 days)\n- Recurring themes across many sessions (e.g. \"this user talks about work stress 70% of the time\")\n- Pattern of when relapses or high-craving days occur relative to habits or days of week\n\nThe `leadingIndicators` detection exists but is limited to 7 days and only checks 4 conditions (missed exercise, missed meditation, mood drop, sobriety break, tracking gap).\n\n### Gap 6: No \"things to remember\" store\n\nUsers cannot explicitly ask Remi to remember something. There is no mechanism for Remi to write a note to a persistent store. The closest thing is `therapistGuidance` (which is write-once from a settings screen, not writable by Remi during conversation).\n\n### Gap 7: DailyMetric notes are not in normal context\n\n`DailyMetric.notes` (free-text) is available in the `get_metrics` tool result, but Remi must explicitly call the tool with the right date range to see those notes. They are not in the auto-assembled context window.\n\n### Gap 8: The memory search doesn't cover assistant messages\n\n`searchRelevantHistory` only indexes user messages and user-type journal entries.

Let me compile the complete analysis.\n\n---\n\n# Complete Memory and Context System Analysis for Remi\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nRemi's awareness of the user is assembled from two distinct pipelines depending on where in the flow a request originates:\n\n1. **Greeting pipeline** (`buildGreetingContext`) — fires once when the user opens the app to generate the opening message. Uses the most context sources.\n2. **Chat pipeline** (`buildContextWindow` + `runAgent`) — fires for every user message. Adds the agent tool loop on top.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Context Sources for `buildContextWindow()` and `buildGreetingContext()`\n\nBoth functions in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/orchestrator.ts` fetch data in parallel and assemble a `ContextWindow` object that `buildSystemPrompt()` serializes into sections appended to Remi's base system prompt.\n\n### Sources fetched by `buildContextWindow()` (lines 287-296)\n\n| Source | Vault call | What it provides |\n|---|---|---|\n| `UserProfile` | `vault.getProfile()` | Name, commitment statement, vulnerability pattern, substances, sobriety start date |\n| `DailyMetric[]` | `vault.getMetrics({ limit: 7 })` | Last 7 days of habit booleans, mood scores, craving intensity, sleep, anxiety |\n| `TherapistGuidance[]` | `vault.getActiveGuidance()` | Active therapist notes injected verbatim |\n| `ChatMessage[]` (current session) | `vault.getChatHistory(currentSessionId)` | Full in-session conversation replay (up to 50 messages) |\n| `SessionSummary[]` (2 previous) | `getRecentSessionSummaries(2)` | Summarized themes/arc for the 2 most recent non-today sessions |\n| `SupportNetwork` | `vault.getSupportNetwork()` | Tier 1/Tier 2 support people with roles |\n| `ActivityInsightsResult` | `getActivityInsights()` | Per-widget completion counts, last-used timestamps, suggested activities, practice gaps |\n| `MemoryItem[]` (keyword search) | `searchRelevantHistory(currentMessage, sessionId)` | Up to 16 journal entries + past chat messages scored by keyword/theme match |\n\n`buildGreetingContext()` is a superset: it also calls `getPreviousSessionSummary()` (the single most recent non-today session with full emotional arc and unresolved-concern notes) and composes a detailed greeting instruction as the `currentMessage` field. It does **not** call `searchRelevantHistory` because no user message exists yet.\n\n### How it becomes the system prompt\n\n`buildSystemPrompt()` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/inference/anthropic.ts` (lines 308-477) appends all context as labeled Markdown sections after the base `REMMI_SYSTEM_PROMPT`:\n\n```\n## User's Commitment Statement\n## Vulnerability Pattern\n## Substance(s) of Focus\n## Current Context          (temporal: time, days sober, streak, new-user note)\n## Active Therapist Guidance\n## Leading Indicators (Risk Signals)\n## Recent Metrics (last 7 days)\n## Activity Usage\n## Recent Session History    (last 2 sessions, compact format)\n## Relevant History          (memory search results)\n## Support Network\n## Safety Note               (crisis context, if any)\n```\n\nThe recent conversation goes into the `messages[]` array (not the system prompt) — up to 50 messages in the Anthropic API call.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Memory Search Service\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memorySearch.ts`\n\nThis is a client-side, keyword-extraction + theme-matching search. It is called once per user message via `searchRelevantHistory(currentMessage, currentSessionId)` (orchestrator line 295).\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Keyword extraction** — strips stop words from the current message, keeps tokens 3+ chars. A 200-word stop list is hardcoded.\n2. **Theme detection** — 11 hardcoded theme buckets (`craving`, `stress`, `relationships`, `work`, `emotions`, `progress`, `relapse`, `sleep`, `health`, `gratitude`, `trigger`). Each bucket is a list of exact-match keywords.\n3. **Data fetch** — pulls two sources in parallel:\n   - Journal entries from the last 60 days (`JOURNAL_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 60`), `entryType === 'user'` only.\n   - User messages from up to 5 past sessions (`MAX_PAST_SESSIONS = 5`), assistant messages excluded.\n4. **Scoring** — each candidate gets +1 per keyword match, +0.5 per theme word match. No semantic understanding.\n5. **Deduplication** — exact prefix dedup on first 80 chars.\n6. **Output** — top 16 entries (`MAX_ENTRIES`), each truncated to ~600 chars. Total budget: 2400 tokens.\n\n### What it does well\n- Retrieves genuinely related past content when the current message shares concrete vocabulary with past entries.\n- Has a sensible token budget.\n\n### What it misses\n- No semantic similarity. \"I'm struggling\" won't match \"I'm having a hard time.\"\n- Only searches 5 past sessions and 60 days of journal. Long-term users lose older context entirely.\n- Only indexes `user` messages from chat and `user`-type journal entries — Remi's own past responses (which contain the widget params Remi chose) are not searched.\n- No weighting for recency within the score — a 58-day-old entry with 3 keyword hits outranks a 2-day-old entry with 2 hits.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Session Summaries\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/sessionSummarizer.ts`\n\nSummaries are computed on-demand by re-reading raw chat messages from the vault each time — they are **not persisted**. Every call to `getRecentSessionSummaries(2)` or `getPreviousSessionSummary()` re-decrypts and re-analyzes the last N sessions from scratch.\n\n### `SessionSummary` type (from `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/types/index.ts`, lines 611-620)\n\n```typescript\ninterface SessionSummary {\n  sessionId: string\n  date: string\n  themes: string[]          // keyword-matched from the same THEME_KEYWORDS dict\n  emotionalArc: EmotionalArc // 'improving' | 'stable' | 'declining' | 'crisis-managed' | 'unknown'\n  widgetsUsed: WidgetId[]\n  endState: SessionEndState  // 'resolved' | 'unresolved' | 'open-ended'\n  userIntentions?: string[]  // regex-matched phrases like \"I'll try to...\"\n  messageCount: number\n}\n```\n\n### How `emotionalArc` is determined (lines 74-110)\n\n- If any message has `crisisLevel` of `emergency` or `urgent`, it's a crisis session. If the last third of messages have no crisis level, it returns `crisis-managed`; otherwise `declining`.\n- Otherwise: compares positive/negative keyword counts in the first half vs second half of user messages. Threshold is ±1 net score difference.\n\n### How `endState` is determined (lines 132-156)\n\nKeyword matching on the last 1-2 user messages:\n- `resolved` if \"thank\", \"helped\", \"better now\", \"bye\", etc. appear.\n- `unresolved` if \"still\", \"not sure\", \"don't know\", \"scared\", etc. appear.\n- `open-ended` otherwise.\n\n### How `userIntentions` are extracted (lines 161-180)\n\nRegex patterns: `I'll`, `I will`, `I want to`, `I need to`, `my goal is to`, `I'm going to try`. Capped at 3 results.\n\n### What persists between sessions\n\nSession summaries provide Remi with:\n- Themes from the last 2 sessions.\n- Whether the previous session ended unresolved (triggers a check-in instruction in the greeting/chat context).\n- Whether the user was emotionally declining (triggers \"be extra supportive\" note).\n- Widgets used.\n- Stated intentions (rough follow-up potential).\n\n### Critical gap\n\nSummaries are computed fresh every time and not persisted. For a user with 100 sessions, computing 2 summaries means loading and decrypting 2×N messages. No summary data ever accumulates into a longer-term user model.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Vault Storage — Full Inventory\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/vault.ts`\n\nAll data is AES-GCM-256 encrypted via PBKDF2-derived key. The key lives only in memory (`getCurrentKey()`). The vault's IndexedDB schema (Dexie) stores these tables:\n\n| Table | Data model | Used for Remi? |\n|---|---|---|\n| `userProfile` | `UserProfile` | Yes — commitment statement, vulnerability pattern, substances, sobriety start, name |\n| `emergencyContacts` | `EmergencyContact` | Not injected into Remi context currently |\n| `supportNetwork` | `SupportPerson` (tier 1/2) | Yes — full network with names and roles |\n| `dailyMetrics` | `DailyMetric` (keyed by date) | Yes — last 7 days of habits, mood, sleep, anxiety, cravings |\n| `journalEntries` | `JournalEntry` | Yes — searched by `memorySearch` (60-day window, user entries only) |\n| `chatMessages` | `ChatMessage` (with widgets) | Yes — current session via `getChatHistory`, past 5 sessions via `searchRelevantHistory` |\n| `therapistGuidance` | `TherapistGuidance` | Yes — active items only |\n| `metricsConfig` | `MetricsConfig` | No — user's metric customization, not in context |\n| `activityLogs` | `ActivityLog` (with `result`) | Partially — only completion counts and last-used times via `activityInsights` |\n| `dailyPracticeConfig` | `DailyPracticeConfig` | Yes — which activities are enabled, for `activityInsights` |\n| `settings` | `AppSettings` | No |\n\n### Notably unused vault data\n\n- `activityLog.result` — the structured outcome of each widget (e.g. what triggers, intensity, and steps the user went through in a DENTS session) is stored but never surfaced to Remi.\n- `emergencyContact` — not passed to Remi despite the support network being passed.\n- `metricsConfig` — Remi doesn't know which custom metrics the user has configured.\n- `DailyMetric.notes` — free-text notes on each day's check-in are in the type definition but not explicitly formatted in the metrics section of the system prompt (though they would appear if `analyze_trends` returns them via `get_metrics` tool).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Agent Tools — Available During Normal Chat\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/agentTools.ts` (definitions)\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/agent/runner.ts` (execution)\n\nThe agent loop (`runAgent`) is always active during normal chat. Every `sendMessage()` call goes through `runAgent` (useChat.ts, lines 160-183). The agent has three tools available:\n\n### `search_conversations`\n- Searches up to 20 recent sessions by keyword (content match + widget ID match via `WIDGET_SEARCH_TERMS`).\n- Date range filtering on session ID timestamp.\n- Returns: session date, message count, preview of first user message, up to 5 matching messages (truncated to 300 chars each).\n- Supports widget-aware search: \"dichotomy of control\" → finds W_STOIC completions.\n\n### `get_metrics`\n- Returns daily metrics with optional trend analysis.\n- Can go back arbitrarily far with `after_date`.\n- Trend analysis: avg mood, mood trend direction, sobriety streak, exercise/meditation days, craving frequency.\n- Does not return `DailyMetric.notes`.\n\n### `search_journal`\n- Filters by tags: `craving`, `rationalization`, `trigger`, `gratitude`, `relapse`, `victory`, `therapy-prep`, `urge-surfed`, `distortion-caught`.\n- Returns entry content (truncated to 500 chars), tags, sentiment.\n- No keyword search — only tag-based filtering.\n\n### When tools are actually invoked\n\nThe system prompt (`remmi.ts`, lines 169-210) instructs Remi to call tools when the user references past history. The agentic loop runs up to `MAX_AGENT_ITERATIONS = 5` (useChat.ts line 16). Tools are NOT automatically called — they require Remi to proactively decide to use them. The pre-assembled context from `buildContextWindow` already provides the most recent 7 days of metrics and 2 session summaries, so Remi may not always feel the need to call tools even when historical data would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n## 6. System Prompt — What Remi Is Told About Memory\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/prompts/remmi.ts` (lines 169-210)\n\nThe `## CRITICAL: Memory and Tools` section explicitly tells Remi:\n\n> \"You have NO persistent memory. Each conversation starts fresh. You cannot recall what the user said yesterday, last week, or in previous sessions. The context window only contains the current session's messages.\"\n\nAnd:\n\n> \"To access ANY historical information, you MUST use the search tools. This is not optional.\"\n\nThis is aspirationally correct — Remi must use tools for anything older than what's in the injected context. However, the injected context already contains 7 days of metrics, 2 session summaries, and a memory search of the last 60 days of journal/5 sessions. So in practice Remi has substantial passive context without calling any tools. The instruction to \"always use tools\" is somewhat in tension with the rich pre-built context.\n\n---\n\n## 7. The Gaps — What Remi Does NOT Have\n\n### Gap 1: No persistent user model / long-term memory store\n\nThere is no \"user model\" document or fact store that accumulates across sessions. Things like:\n- \"User mentioned their father as a main trigger in April\"\n- \"User prefers CBT over Stoic exercises\"\n- \"User has relapsed twice, both times on Friday evenings after work stress\"\n- \"User explicitly asked Remi to follow up on their therapy appointment\"\n\nThese exist only as raw messages. To find them, Remi must call `search_conversations` with exactly the right keyword, which it often won't know to do.\n\n### Gap 2: `activityLog.result` is never surfaced\n\nEvery widget completion stores a structured `result` in the `ActivityLog`. For example, a DENTS session presumably stores the trigger, intensity, and which steps the user completed. This outcome data is completely invisible to Remi. `activityInsights` only exposes counts and timestamps, not what actually happened inside each exercise.\n\n### Gap 3: Session summaries are re-computed and only cover 2 sessions\n\nRemi can only see the last 2 session summaries in normal chat. For a user with months of history, sessions 3-100 are completely invisible unless Remi explicitly searches. The summaries are also recomputed every time (no caching or persistence), and they're shallow (keyword matching, not semantic understanding of what the user was actually working through).\n\n### Gap 4: `search_journal` has no keyword search\n\nJournal entries can only be found by their pre-assigned tags. If the user journaled about \"my brother's wedding making me want to drink\" but it was tagged as `craving` and the user is now asking about \"family pressure\", Remi can find it by tag but has no way to do a semantic search. Keywords within journal content are only searchable via `memorySearch.ts` — but that's already run automatically and only covers 60 days.\n\n### Gap 5: Emotional pattern data is not aggregated\n\nRemi gets a 7-day mood snapshot and the emotional arc of 2 sessions. There is no aggregated view of:\n- Long-term mood trend (30/60/90 days)\n- Recurring themes across many sessions (e.g. \"this user talks about work stress 70% of the time\")\n- Pattern of when relapses or high-craving days occur relative to habits or days of week\n\nThe `leadingIndicators` detection exists but is limited to 7 days and only checks 4 conditions (missed exercise, missed meditation, mood drop, sobriety break, tracking gap).\n\n### Gap 6: No \"things to remember\" store\n\nUsers cannot explicitly ask Remi to remember something. There is no mechanism for Remi to write a note to a persistent store. The closest thing is `therapistGuidance` (which is write-once from a settings screen, not writable by Remi during conversation).\n\n### Gap 7: DailyMetric notes are not in normal context\n\n`DailyMetric.notes` (free-text) is available in the `get_metrics` tool result, but Remi must explicitly call the tool with the right date range to see those notes. They are not in the auto-assembled context window.\n\n### Gap 8: The memory search doesn't cover assistant messages\n\n`searchRelevantHistory` only indexes user messages and user-type journal entries. Remi's own past responses — including the CBT reframes, Stoic framings, and motivational content it generated — are not searchable. Remi can't see what it told the user last time they discussed the same trigger.\n\n### Gap 9: Greeting context is richer than in-session context\n\n`buildGreetingContext` (greeting) calls `getPreviousSessionSummary()` for a single full-detail session, while `buildContextWindow` (normal chat) calls `getRecentSessionSummaries(2)` for 2 compact summaries. The greeting is actually smarter than mid-session responses in terms of session context richness.\n\n---\n\n## Essential Files Summary\n\nThese files are the definitive reference for understanding and extending Remi's memory:\n\n| File | Why it matters |\n|---|---|\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/orchestrator.ts` | Assembles all context — this is the master controller |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/inference/anthropic.ts` | `buildSystemPrompt()` is where context becomes the AI's reality |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memorySearch.ts` | The only cross-session semantic (keyword) search |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/sessionSummarizer.ts` | Session-to-summary pipeline; no persistence |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/agentTools.ts` | Tool definitions and execution; Remi's active memory access |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/agent/runner.ts` | The agentic loop — drives tool invocation and continuation |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/prompts/remmi.ts` | Remi's self-model, including instructions about memory |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/types/index.ts` | All data models, including `SessionSummary`, `MemoryItem`, `ContextWindow` |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/vault.ts` | Everything stored — shows what raw material is available |\n| `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/composables/useChat.ts` | Entry point for all chat; shows how the pipeline is triggered |"}],"totalDurationMs":130011,"totalTokens":78755,"totalToolUseCount":19,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5459,"cache_read_input_tokens":68387,"output_tokens":4908,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":5459,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"b888eee5-b346-49a3-b7d7-367a4e3a7533"}

Now I have enough to propose approaches. Here are three:\n\n---\n\n## Approach 1: Session-End Memory Extraction (Recommended)\n\nAt the end of each session (or when the app backgrounds), send the full conversation to Claude with a structured extraction prompt. Claude returns a list of **memory items** categorized as:\n\n- **User facts** — \"Main trigger is work stress,\" \"Has a brother named Mike,\" \"Prefers DENTS over Stoic exercises\"\n- **Follow-ups** — \"Wants to discuss therapy appointment next time,\" \"Committed to trying meditation this week\"\n- **Emotional state** — \"Ended session feeling hopeful about job interview\"\n- **Patterns noted** — \"Third session mentioning Friday evening cravings\"\n\nThese get persisted as encrypted `MemoryItem` records in the vault. On each new session, the orchestrator loads relevant memories (by recency + keyword relevance to the conversation) and injects them into the system prompt as a \"What you know about this user\" section.\n\n**Pros:** Highest quality extraction, semantic understanding, catches nuance. Single extra API call per session.\n**Cons:** Extra API cost. Slight delay at session end. Memory accumulates and needs pruning/consolidation over time.\n\n---\n\n## Approach 2: Inline Memory Extraction (During Conversation)\n\nGive Remi a `save_memory` tool it can call mid-conversation whenever it notices something worth remembering. Similar to how ChatGPT's memory works — Remi decides in real-time what to save.\n\n**Pros:** No separate extraction step. Remi saves exactly what it thinks matters. User can see \"Memory saved\" inline.\n**Cons:** Remi may forget to call the tool. Uses tool call budget (currently max 5 iterations). Quality depends on Remi's judgment during the flow of conversation. May feel intrusive.\n\n---\n\n## Approach 3: Combined (Session-End + Inline Tool)\n\nUse Approach 1 as the primary mechanism (guaranteed extraction after every session) plus give Remi the `save_memory` tool for explicit \"remember this\" moments during conversation.\n\n**Pros:** Best of both — guaranteed baseline plus real-time responsiveness. Covers cases where users say \"Remember that I...\" explicitly.\n**Cons:** Most complex. Potential for duplicate memories. Needs dedup logic.\n\n---\n\n**My recommendation is Approach 1 (Session-End Extraction)** for the first iteration. It's the highest-impact change with the cleanest implementation. The inline tool (Approach 2) can be added later as an enhancement. The session-end extraction guarantees nothing is missed, while the inline tool is only as good as Remi's judgment about when to use it.\n\nWhat do you think — does Approach 1 sound right, or would you prefer one of the others?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":90,"cache_read_input_tokens":61793,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":90},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYP1MZ33gxvgmJcwQcu7E","type":"assistant","uuid":"e1ce0751-a9a2-4477-8ff2-fcd1ffa41562","timestamp":"2026-02-22T11:12:13.132Z"}

Injects as a `## What You Know About This User` section in the system prompt. This replaces the current shallow `previousSession` summary.\n\n**`buildContextWindow()`** — same injection. Remi always sees the user facts and recent daily summaries, without needing to call any tools.\n\n**Metrics** — per your requirement, Remi should always be aware of metrics. The current system already injects 7 days of metrics into the context. I'd expand this to include the `DailyMetric.notes` field (currently omitted) so Remi sees the user's free-text notes alongside the numbers.\n\nDoes this design look right?

If so, asynchronously gather all activity since the last memory, send to Claude for structured extraction, and persist as an encrypted `DailyMemory` record.

Copy all existing stores from version 4 and add `dailyMemories`:\n\n```typescript\nthis.version(5).stores({\n  userProfile: 'id, updatedAt',\n  emergencyContacts: 'id, updatedAt',\n  supportNetwork: 'id, tier, updatedAt',\n  dailyMetrics: 'date, updatedAt',\n  journalEntries: 'id, sessionId, timestamp, *tags',\n  chatMessages: 'id, sessionId, timestamp, role',\n  therapistGuidance: 'id, category, active, updatedAt',\n  metricsConfig: 'id, updatedAt',\n  activityLogs: 'id, activityId, completedAt',\n  dailyPracticeConfig: 'id, updatedAt',\n  dailyMemories: 'id, date, coveringTo, createdAt',\n  settings: 'key',\n  metadata: 'key'\n})\n```\n\n**Step 4: Commit**\n\n```bash\ngit add src/services/database.ts\ngit commit -m \"feat(memory): add dailyMemories table to database schema\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Task 3: Add vault CRUD for DailyMemory\n\n**Files:** Modify: `src/services/vault.ts`\n\n**Step 1: Add import for DailyMemory type**\n\nAdd `DailyMemory` to the import from `@/types` at the top of the file (~line 8).\n\n**Step 2: Add vault functions**\n\nAdd a new section after the Activity Logs section. Follow the existing patterns in the file (e.g. `getMetrics`, `saveMetric`):\n\n```typescript\n// ============================================\n// Daily Memories\n// ============================================\n\nexport async function getDailyMemories(options: {\n  after?: string\n  limit?: number\n} = {}): Promise<DailyMemory[]> {\n  const { key } = requireUnlocked()\n  const db = getDatabase()\n\n  let query = db.dailyMemories.orderBy('date').reverse()\n\n  if (options.after) {\n    query = query.filter(m => m.date >= options.after!)\n  }\n  if (options.limit) {\n    query = query.limit(options.limit)\n  }\n\n  const entries = await query.toArray()\n  const memories: DailyMemory[] = []\n\n  for (const entry of entries) {\n    const memory = await decryptObject<DailyMemory>(entry.data, key)\n    memories.push(memory)\n  }\n\n  return memories\n}\n\nexport async function getLatestDailyMemory(): Promise<DailyMemory | null> {\n  const { key } = requireUnlocked()\n  const db = getDatabase()\n\n  const entry = await db.dailyMemories.orderBy('date').reverse().first()\n  if (!entry) return null\n\n  return decryptObject<DailyMemory>(entry.data, key)\n}\n\nexport async function saveDailyMemory(memory: DailyMemory): Promise<void> {\n  const { key, salt } = requireUnlocked()\n  const db = getDatabase()\n\n  const encrypted = await encryptObject(memory, key, salt)\n  await db.dailyMemories.put({\n    id: memory.id,\n    date: memory.date,\n    coveringTo: memory.coveringTo,\n    data: encrypted,\n    createdAt: memory.createdAt\n  })\n}\n\nexport async function getAllUserFacts(): Promise<string[]> {\n  const memories = await getDailyMemories({ limit: 30 })\n  if (memories.length === 0) return []\n  return memories[0].userFacts\n}\n```\n\n**Step 3: Run typecheck**\n\nRun: `npm run typecheck`\nExpected: PASS\n\n**Step 4: Commit**\n\n```bash\ngit add src/services/vault.ts\ngit commit -m \"feat(memory): add vault CRUD for daily memories\"\n```\n\n## Context\n\nThis is part of a daily memory extraction system for RecoveryLM. The `DailyMemory` type was just added in Task 1. Task 2 adds the Dexie table, Task 3 adds encrypted CRUD. The vault pattern uses AES-GCM-256 encryption — follow existing patterns like `getMetrics`/`saveMetric` exactly. The `requireUnlocked()` helper returns `{ key, salt }`.\n\n## Your Job\n\n1.

It uses the Anthropic SDK directly (not the orchestrator) since this is a background utility call.\n\n## Important Context\n\n- The app uses `@anthropic-ai/sdk` directly (already a dependency)\n- Check `src/services/inference/anthropic.ts` for how the Anthropic client is configured (proxy support, API key, `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true`)\n- The vault functions you'll need are in `src/services/vault.ts`: `getMetrics`, `getJournalEntries`, `getChatHistory`, `getRecentSessions`, `getLatestDailyMemory`, `saveDailyMemory`, `getAllUserFacts`\n- `generateId` and `today` are from `@/types`\n- Session IDs have format: `session_{timestamp}_{random}`\n- Use model `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for extraction (cheap, fast)\n- Types: `DailyMemory`, `DailyMetric`, `JournalEntry`, `ChatMessage` from `@/types`\n\n## Full Implementation\n\nCreate `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts` with:\n\n1. **`getClient()`** — Create Anthropic client with proxy support (same pattern as anthropic.ts)\n\n2. **`gatherActivity(since: string)`** — Fetch all activity since a date:\n   - `vault.getMetrics({ after: since })`\n   - `vault.getJournalEntries({ after: sinceTimestamp })` (convert date string to timestamp)\n   - `vault.getRecentSessions(20)` then load chat history for sessions whose timestamp >= sinceTimestamp (parse timestamp from session ID)\n   - `vault.getAllUserFacts()` for previous facts\n   - Return `{ chatMessages, journalEntries, metrics, previousFacts }`\n\n3. **`buildExtractionPrompt(activity)`** — Format raw activity into a prompt string with sections for conversations, journal entries, daily check-ins, and previous facts\n\n4. **`extractDailyMemory(coveringFrom: string)`** — Main function:\n   - Gather activity, return minimal memory if no activity (preserving previous facts)\n   - Otherwise build prompt, call Claude, parse JSON response\n   - Return a `DailyMemory` object\n\n5. **`runMemoryExtractionIfNeeded()`** — Entry point:\n   - Get latest memory via `vault.getLatestDailyMemory()`\n   - If already extracted today, return\n   - Otherwise determine coveringFrom (latest memory's coveringTo, or today if no memory)\n   - If coveringFrom === today, return (first day, nothing to extract)\n   - Call `extractDailyMemory()`, save result with `vault.saveDailyMemory()`\n   - Wrap everything in try/catch — this is non-blocking, log errors but don't throw\n\n## System Prompt for Extraction\n\n```\nYou are a memory extraction system for a recovery support app. Your job is to analyze a user's recent activity and extract structured memories.\n\nYou will receive the user's conversations with their AI companion Remi, journal entries, and daily check-in metrics.\n\nRespond with ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:\n{\n  \"conversationSummary\": \"Brief summary of what was discussed (or null if no conversations)\",\n  \"journalSummary\": \"Brief summary of journal entries (or null if no entries)\",\n  \"checkinSummary\": \"Brief summary of check-in trends (or null if no check-ins)\",\n  \"userFacts\": [\"Durable facts about this person. Include ALL previous facts that are still true, plus any new ones. Remove any that are now contradicted.\"],\n  \"followUps\": [\"Things to follow up on\"],\n  \"emotionalState\": \"How the user seemed emotionally during this period\",\n  \"notablePatterns\": [\"Any patterns noticed\"]\n}\n\nGuidelines:\n- Be concise. Each summary should be 1-3 sentences.\n- userFacts should be durable truths, not transient states. Include the full updated list (previous facts + new - contradicted).\n- followUps are time-sensitive items Remi should bring up.\n- notablePatterns should only include clear patterns, not speculation.\n- If a section has no data, use null for summaries and empty arrays for lists.\n```\n\n## Your Job\n\n1. Create the file with all functions described above\n2. Run `npm run typecheck` to verify\n3. Commit: `git commit -m \"feat(memory): add LLM-powered daily memory extraction service\"`\n4.

Remove any that are now contradicted.\"],\n  \"followUps\": [\"Things to follow up on\"],\n  \"emotionalState\": \"How the user seemed emotionally during this period\",\n  \"notablePatterns\": [\"Any patterns noticed\"]\n}\n\nGuidelines:\n- Be concise. Each summary should be 1-3 sentences.\n- userFacts should be durable truths, not transient states. Include the full updated list (previous facts + new - contradicted).\n- followUps are time-sensitive items Remi should bring up.\n- notablePatterns should only include clear patterns, not speculation.\n- If a section has no data, use null for summaries and empty arrays for lists.\n```\n\n## Your Job\n\n1.

You need to load daily memories and user facts in both context-building functions.\n\n## Changes to `buildGreetingContext()` (~line 169)\n\n**Step 1: Add daily memories to the parallel fetch**\n\nThe function has a `Promise.all` block that fetches data. Add `vault.getDailyMemories({ limit: 5 })` and `vault.getAllUserFacts()` to it. Update the destructuring:\n\n```typescript\nconst [profile, metrics, guidance, recentSessionIds, activityData, previousSession, supportNetwork, dailyMemories, userFacts] = await Promise.all([\n  vault.getProfile(),\n  vault.getMetrics({ limit: 7 }),\n  vault.getActiveGuidance(),\n  vault.getRecentSessions(5),\n  getActivityInsights(),\n  getPreviousSessionSummary(),\n  vault.getSupportNetwork(),\n  vault.getDailyMemories({ limit: 5 }),\n  vault.getAllUserFacts()\n])\n```\n\n**Step 2: Add user facts section to the greeting instruction**\n\nBefore the greeting instruction string (around line 234), build a user facts section:\n\n```typescript\nconst userFactsSection = userFacts.length > 0\n  ? `\\n--- WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS USER ---\\n${userFacts.map(f => `- ${f}`).join('\\n')}\\n`\n  : ''\n```\n\nThen insert `${userFactsSection}` into the greeting instruction — add it between `${activitySection}` and `--- GREETING GUIDELINES ---`. Look at the existing template string to find the right spot.\n\n**Step 3: Add dailyMemories to the returned ContextWindow**\n\nIn the return object, add `dailyMemories`:\n\n```typescript\nreturn {\n  ...existing fields...,\n  dailyMemories\n}\n```\n\n## Changes to `buildContextWindow()` (~line 281)\n\n**Step 4: Add daily memories to the parallel fetch**\n\nSame pattern — add to the Promise.all and destructuring:\n\n```typescript\nconst [profile, metrics, guidance, recentChat, sessionSummaries, supportNetwork, activityData, relevantHistory, dailyMemories] = await Promise.all([\n  vault.getProfile(),\n  vault.getMetrics({ limit: 7 }),\n  vault.getActiveGuidance(),\n  vault.getChatHistory(currentSessionId),\n  getRecentSessionSummaries(2),\n  vault.getSupportNetwork(),\n  getActivityInsights(),\n  searchRelevantHistory(currentMessage, currentSessionId),\n  vault.getDailyMemories({ limit: 5 })\n])\n```\n\n**Step 5: Add dailyMemories to the return object**\n\nAdd `dailyMemories` to the return statement.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Do NOT change the `isFirstTime` logic (we already fixed it in an earlier commit)\n- The vault functions `getDailyMemories` and `getAllUserFacts` are already available via `vault.*`\n- Run `npm run typecheck` after all changes\n- Commit: `git commit -m \"feat(memory): inject daily memories and user facts into orchestrator context\"`\n\nWork from: /Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm","agentId":"a366c088633eb8b89"},"toolUseID":"agent_msg_01QWfSpbGRqquqYUNTfenfWb","parentToolUseID":"toolu_012wjvicuD51aTfGxfCpJPgA","uuid":"759b9193-fda0-4512-b4bf-58d427c2ff5f","timestamp":"2026-02-22T11:34:47.819Z"}

It builds `contextSections` array and pushes various sections. After the existing session history / relevant history sections, add a new section for daily memories:\n\n```typescript\n// Daily memories and user facts\nif (context.dailyMemories && context.dailyMemories.length > 0) {\n  const memoryLines: string[] = ['## What You Know About This User']\n\n  // User facts (from most recent memory)\n  const latestMemory = context.dailyMemories[0]\n  if (latestMemory.userFacts.length > 0) {\n    memoryLines.push('### Key Facts')\n    memoryLines.push(...latestMemory.userFacts.map(f => `- ${f}`))\n  }\n\n  // Follow-ups\n  if (latestMemory.followUps.length > 0) {\n    memoryLines.push('### Follow-ups')\n    memoryLines.push(...latestMemory.followUps.map(f => `- ${f}`))\n  }\n\n  // Recent daily summaries (last 3 days with content)\n  const recentSummaries = context.dailyMemories\n    .filter(m => m.conversationSummary || m.journalSummary || m.checkinSummary)\n    .slice(0, 3)\n\n  if (recentSummaries.length > 0) {\n    memoryLines.push('### Recent Activity Summaries')\n    for (const mem of recentSummaries) {\n      memoryLines.push(`**${mem.coveringFrom} to ${mem.coveringTo}:**`)\n      if (mem.conversationSummary) memoryLines.push(`- Chat: ${mem.conversationSummary}`)\n      if (mem.journalSummary) memoryLines.push(`- Journal: ${mem.journalSummary}`)\n      if (mem.checkinSummary) memoryLines.push(`- Check-in: ${mem.checkinSummary}`)\n      if (mem.emotionalState) memoryLines.push(`- Emotional state: ${mem.emotionalState}`)\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Notable patterns\n  if (latestMemory.notablePatterns.length > 0) {\n    memoryLines.push('### Patterns')\n    memoryLines.push(...latestMemory.notablePatterns.map(p => `- ${p}`))\n  }\n\n  contextSections.push(memoryLines.join('\\n'))\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: Add metric notes to the existing metrics section**\n\nFind the section that renders recent metrics (starts with `if (context.recentMetrics.length > 0)`). After all the existing metric formatting (habit counts, averages, etc.) and before the `contextSections.push(lines.join('\\n'))`, add:\n\n```typescript\n// Include daily notes\nconst withNotes = metrics.filter(m => m.notes)\nif (withNotes.length > 0) {\n  lines.push('Daily notes:')\n  for (const m of withNotes) {\n    lines.push(`- ${m.date}: ${m.notes}`)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Step 3: Run typecheck, commit**\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"feat(memory): render daily memories and metric notes in system prompt\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Task 8: Update Remi system prompt about memory\n\n**Files:** Modify: `src/prompts/remmi.ts`\n\n**Step 1: Find and update the memory instructions**\n\nFind the section that says something like \"## CRITICAL: Memory and Tools\" or similar that tells Remi \"You have NO persistent memory.\" Replace the blanket \"no memory\" statement with an accurate description. Keep the section about tools but update the framing:\n\n```\n## CRITICAL: Memory and Context\n\nYou have a persistent memory system. Your context includes:\n- **Key facts** you've learned about this user across all sessions\n- **Recent activity summaries** (conversations, journal entries, check-ins)\n- **Follow-up items** from previous sessions\n- **Notable patterns** observed over time\n- **Last 7 days of metrics** with daily notes\n\nThis context is automatically provided — you don't need to search for it. Use it naturally to show you know and remember the user.\n\nFor OLDER history beyond what's in your context, use the search tools:\n- search_conversations: Find past chat messages by keyword\n- get_metrics: Get metrics beyond the last 7 days\n- search_journal: Find journal entries by tag\n\nWhen the user references something not in your current context, use these tools proactively.\n```\n\n**Important:** Read the file first to find the exact section.

Update the destructuring:\n\n```typescript\nconst [profile, metrics, guidance, recentSessionIds, activityData, previousSession, supportNetwork, dailyMemories, userFacts] = await Promise.all([\n  vault.getProfile(),\n  vault.getMetrics({ limit: 7 }),\n  vault.getActiveGuidance(),\n  vault.getRecentSessions(5),\n  getActivityInsights(),\n  getPreviousSessionSummary(),\n  vault.getSupportNetwork(),\n  vault.getDailyMemories({ limit: 5 }),\n  vault.getAllUserFacts()\n])\n```\n\n**Step 2: Add user facts section to the greeting instruction**\n\nBefore the greeting instruction string (around line 234), build a user facts section:\n\n```typescript\nconst userFactsSection = userFacts.length > 0\n  ? `\\n--- WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS USER ---\\n${userFacts.map(f => `- ${f}`).join('\\n')}\\n`\n  : ''\n```\n\nThen insert `${userFactsSection}` into the greeting instruction — add it between `${activitySection}` and `--- GREETING GUIDELINES ---`. Look at the existing template string to find the right spot.\n\n**Step 3: Add dailyMemories to the returned ContextWindow**\n\nIn the return object, add `dailyMemories`:\n\n```typescript\nreturn {\n  ...existing fields...,\n  dailyMemories\n}\n```\n\n## Changes to `buildContextWindow()` (~line 281)\n\n**Step 4: Add daily memories to the parallel fetch**\n\nSame pattern — add to the Promise.all and destructuring:\n\n```typescript\nconst [profile, metrics, guidance, recentChat, sessionSummaries, supportNetwork, activityData, relevantHistory, dailyMemories] = await Promise.all([\n  vault.getProfile(),\n  vault.getMetrics({ limit: 7 }),\n  vault.getActiveGuidance(),\n  vault.getChatHistory(currentSessionId),\n  getRecentSessionSummaries(2),\n  vault.getSupportNetwork(),\n  getActivityInsights(),\n  searchRelevantHistory(currentMessage, currentSessionId),\n  vault.getDailyMemories({ limit: 5 })\n])\n```\n\n**Step 5: Add dailyMemories to the return object**\n\nAdd `dailyMemories` to the return statement.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Do NOT change the `isFirstTime` logic (we already fixed it in an earlier commit)\n- The vault functions `getDailyMemories` and `getAllUserFacts` are already available via `vault.*`\n- Run `npm run typecheck` after all changes\n- Commit: `git commit -m \"feat(memory): inject daily memories and user facts into orchestrator context\"`\n\nWork from: /Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm","agentId":"a366c088633eb8b89"},"toolUseID":"agent_msg_01QWfSpbGRqquqYUNTfenfWb","parentToolUseID":"toolu_012wjvicuD51aTfGxfCpJPgA","uuid":"1f443dca-dd3e-47df-b5e7-65d9db8713c1","timestamp":"2026-02-22T11:35:11.633Z"}

You need to load daily memories and user facts in both context-building functions.\n\n## Changes to `buildGreetingContext()` (~line 169)\n\n**Step 1: Add daily memories to the parallel fetch**\n\nThe function has a `Promise.all` block that fetches data. Add `vault.getDailyMemories({ limit: 5 })` and `vault.getAllUserFacts()` to it. Update the destructuring:\n\n```typescript\nconst [profile, metrics, guidance, recentSessionIds, activityData, previousSession, supportNetwork, dailyMemories, userFacts] = await Promise.all([\n  vault.getProfile(),\n  vault.getMetrics({ limit: 7 }),\n  vault.getActiveGuidance(),\n  vault.getRecentSessions(5),\n  getActivityInsights(),\n  getPreviousSessionSummary(),\n  vault.getSupportNetwork(),\n  vault.getDailyMemories({ limit: 5 }),\n  vault.getAllUserFacts()\n])\n```\n\n**Step 2: Add user facts section to the greeting instruction**\n\nBefore the greeting instruction string (around line 234), build a user facts section:\n\n```typescript\nconst userFactsSection = userFacts.length > 0\n  ? `\\n--- WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS USER ---\\n${userFacts.map(f => `- ${f}`).join('\\n')}\\n`\n  : ''\n```\n\nThen insert `${userFactsSection}` into the greeting instruction — add it between `${activitySection}` and `--- GREETING GUIDELINES ---`. Look at the existing template string to find the right spot.\n\n**Step 3: Add dailyMemories to the returned ContextWindow**\n\nIn the return object, add `dailyMemories`:\n\n```typescript\nreturn {\n  ...existing fields...,\n  dailyMemories\n}\n```\n\n## Changes to `buildContextWindow()` (~line 281)\n\n**Step 4: Add daily memories to the parallel fetch**\n\nSame pattern — add to the Promise.all and destructuring:\n\n```typescript\nconst [profile, metrics, guidance, recentChat, sessionSummaries, supportNetwork, activityData, relevantHistory, dailyMemories] = await Promise.all([\n  vault.getProfile(),\n  vault.getMetrics({ limit: 7 }),\n  vault.getActiveGuidance(),\n  vault.getChatHistory(currentSessionId),\n  getRecentSessionSummaries(2),\n  vault.getSupportNetwork(),\n  getActivityInsights(),\n  searchRelevantHistory(currentMessage, currentSessionId),\n  vault.getDailyMemories({ limit: 5 })\n])\n```\n\n**Step 5: Add dailyMemories to the return object**\n\nAdd `dailyMemories` to the return statement.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Do NOT change the `isFirstTime` logic (we already fixed it in an earlier commit)\n- The vault functions `getDailyMemories` and `getAllUserFacts` are already available via `vault.*`\n- Run `npm run typecheck` after all changes\n- Commit: `git commit -m \"feat(memory): inject daily memories and user facts into orchestrator context\"`\n\nWork from: /Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm","agentId":"a366c088633eb8b89","content":[{"type":"text","text":"All changes are committed.

On vault unlock, the system checks if memory extraction is needed (no memory yet today), gathers all activity since the last extraction (chat messages, journal entries, metrics), sends it to Claude Haiku for structured extraction, and persists the result as an encrypted DailyMemory. Both the greeting and chat orchestrator contexts inject these memories into Remi's system prompt.\n\n## Commits to review\n\nAll commits from `236bd6d` to `4da77b7` (8 commits on `feat/12-remi-memory`):\n\n1. `236bd6d` - DailyMemory type + ContextWindow field (types/index.ts)\n2. `87e2bee` - Database table + v5 migration (database.ts)\n3. `630c573` - Vault CRUD functions (vault.ts)\n4. `98d7082` - Memory extraction service (memoryExtraction.ts - new file)\n5. `8add355` - Login trigger in useVault.ts\n6. `c0b57ea` - Orchestrator context injection (orchestrator.ts)\n7. `b357727` - System prompt rendering (anthropic.ts)\n8. `4da77b7` - Remi system prompt update (remmi.ts)\n\n## Key files to review\n\n- `src/types/index.ts` - DailyMemory interface\n- `src/services/database.ts` - EncryptedDailyMemory + v5 migration\n- `src/services/vault.ts` - CRUD functions\n- `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts` - Core extraction service (NEW FILE - review thoroughly)\n- `src/composables/useVault.ts` - Login trigger\n- `src/services/orchestrator.ts` - Context injection\n- `src/services/inference/anthropic.ts` - Prompt rendering\n- `src/prompts/remmi.ts` - Updated memory instructions\n\n## Requirements/plan\n\nThe plan is at `docs/plans/2026-02-22-daily-memory-extraction-plan.md`. The design is at `docs/plans/2026-02-22-daily-memory-extraction-design.md`.\n\n## What to focus on\n\n1. Does the extraction trigger correctly (only when needed, non-blocking)?\n2. Does gatherActivity correctly find all activity since the last memory?\n3. Is the extraction prompt well-designed for structured JSON output?\n4.

On vault unlock, the system checks if memory extraction is needed (no memory yet today), gathers all activity since the last extraction (chat messages, journal entries, metrics), sends it to Claude Haiku for structured extraction, and persists the result as an encrypted DailyMemory. Both the greeting and chat orchestrator contexts inject these memories into Remi's system prompt.\n\n## Commits to review\n\nAll commits from `236bd6d` to `4da77b7` (8 commits on `feat/12-remi-memory`):\n\n1. `236bd6d` - DailyMemory type + ContextWindow field (types/index.ts)\n2. `87e2bee` - Database table + v5 migration (database.ts)\n3. `630c573` - Vault CRUD functions (vault.ts)\n4. `98d7082` - Memory extraction service (memoryExtraction.ts - new file)\n5. `8add355` - Login trigger in useVault.ts\n6. `c0b57ea` - Orchestrator context injection (orchestrator.ts)\n7. `b357727` - System prompt rendering (anthropic.ts)\n8. `4da77b7` - Remi system prompt update (remmi.ts)\n\n## Key files to review\n\n- `src/types/index.ts` - DailyMemory interface\n- `src/services/database.ts` - EncryptedDailyMemory + v5 migration\n- `src/services/vault.ts` - CRUD functions\n- `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts` - Core extraction service (NEW FILE - review thoroughly)\n- `src/composables/useVault.ts` - Login trigger\n- `src/services/orchestrator.ts` - Context injection\n- `src/services/inference/anthropic.ts` - Prompt rendering\n- `src/prompts/remmi.ts` - Updated memory instructions\n\n## Requirements/plan\n\nThe plan is at `docs/plans/2026-02-22-daily-memory-extraction-plan.md`. The design is at `docs/plans/2026-02-22-daily-memory-extraction-design.md`.\n\n## What to focus on\n\n1. Does the extraction trigger correctly (only when needed, non-blocking)?\n2. Does gatherActivity correctly find all activity since the last memory?\n3. Is the extraction prompt well-designed for structured JSON output?\n4. Are memories properly injected into both greeting and chat contexts?\n5. Any security concerns (encryption, data handling)?\n6. Any race conditions or error handling gaps?\n\nBASE_SHA: 236bd6d~1\nHEAD_SHA: 4da77b7","agentId":"a17c67055f6f88032"},"toolUseID":"agent_msg_013GgyZhCyUJidUxPH8KJmcb","parentToolUseID":"toolu_012imG9gTZ8mjS3PdMtocGED","uuid":"0aa0b3b8-50ba-4c2b-838a-09b70895608c","timestamp":"2026-02-22T11:36:57.043Z"}

Both the greeting and chat orchestrator contexts inject these memories into Remi's system prompt.\n\n## Commits to review\n\nAll commits from `236bd6d` to `4da77b7` (8 commits on `feat/12-remi-memory`):\n\n1. `236bd6d` - DailyMemory type + ContextWindow field (types/index.ts)\n2. `87e2bee` - Database table + v5 migration (database.ts)\n3. `630c573` - Vault CRUD functions (vault.ts)\n4. `98d7082` - Memory extraction service (memoryExtraction.ts - new file)\n5. `8add355` - Login trigger in useVault.ts\n6. `c0b57ea` - Orchestrator context injection (orchestrator.ts)\n7. `b357727` - System prompt rendering (anthropic.ts)\n8. `4da77b7` - Remi system prompt update (remmi.ts)\n\n## Key files to review\n\n- `src/types/index.ts` - DailyMemory interface\n- `src/services/database.ts` - EncryptedDailyMemory + v5 migration\n- `src/services/vault.ts` - CRUD functions\n- `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts` - Core extraction service (NEW FILE - review thoroughly)\n- `src/composables/useVault.ts` - Login trigger\n- `src/services/orchestrator.ts` - Context injection\n- `src/services/inference/anthropic.ts` - Prompt rendering\n- `src/prompts/remmi.ts` - Updated memory instructions\n\n## Requirements/plan\n\nThe plan is at `docs/plans/2026-02-22-daily-memory-extraction-plan.md`. The design is at `docs/plans/2026-02-22-daily-memory-extraction-design.md`.\n\n## What to focus on\n\n1. Does the extraction trigger correctly (only when needed, non-blocking)?\n2. Does gatherActivity correctly find all activity since the last memory?\n3. Is the extraction prompt well-designed for structured JSON output?\n4. Are memories properly injected into both greeting and chat contexts?\n5. Any security concerns (encryption, data handling)?\n6. Any race conditions or error handling gaps?\n\nBASE_SHA: 236bd6d~1\nHEAD_SHA: 4da77b7","agentId":"a17c67055f6f88032"},"toolUseID":"agent_msg_013GgyZhCyUJidUxPH8KJmcb","parentToolUseID":"toolu_012imG9gTZ8mjS3PdMtocGED","uuid":"b5a445c7-d76f-4691-a798-fffaf8e28937","timestamp":"2026-02-22T11:36:57.561Z"}

You are a knowledgeable companion—think of yourself as a well-read friend who's always available, trained in the frameworks that support recovery, and genuinely invested in the person's wellbeing.\n    17→\n    18→## Philosophical Foundation\n    19→\n    20→RecoveryLM is built on the **Independent Recovery Framework (IRF)**, which integrates:\n    21→\n    22→- **SMART Recovery** principles: Self-empowerment, evidence-based techniques, cognitive-behavioral focus\n    23→- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Identifying automatic thoughts, cognitive distortions, and examining evidence\n    24→- **Stoic Philosophy**: The dichotomy of control, the impression-to-assent gap, building aversion toward reactive responses\n    25→- **Structured Accountability**: Support networks, leading indicators, external constraints built while clear-headed\n    26→\n    27→These frameworks converge on a central insight: **the problem isn't the impression, craving, or trigger—it's the unexamined assent.** Recovery involves building the capacity to notice mental events without automatically acting on them.\n    28→\n    29→## Understanding Vulnerability Patterns\n    30→\n    31→### The Craving Pattern\n    32→Some people struggle primarily with acute cravings—intense urges that demand immediate relief. For these users:\n    33→- Focus on urge surfing and distress tolerance\n    34→- The challenge is riding out the 30-60 minute wave\n    35→- Deploy DENTS protocol actively during acute episodes\n    36→- Remind them that urges peak and pass\n    37→\n    38→### The Rationalization Pattern\n    39→Others handle acute cravings well but are vulnerable to rationalization during stable periods. The danger isn't \"I desperately need this\"—it's persuasive internal arguments like:\n    40→- \"I've proven I can quit. I'm in control now.\"\n    41→- \"I've been so disciplined. I deserve this.\"\n    42→- \"I'll just use occasionally, not like before.\"\n    43→\n    44→For these users:\n    45→- Highest risk is when things are going *well*\n    46→- Watch for these thoughts and name them when they appear\n    47→- Use \"Play the Tape Through\" to counter the incomplete mental movie\n    48→- Be alert to \"seemingly irrelevant decisions\"\n    49→\n    50→## Core Tools and Techniques\n    51→\n    52→You have access to interactive widgets that render as UI elements in the chat. **You MUST include widget commands in your response** when appropriate—they will be automatically parsed and displayed as interactive tools.\n    53→\n    54→**CRITICAL**: When a user explicitly requests a tool (e.g., \"I need the DENTS protocol\", \"do my check-in\", \"urge surfing\"), you MUST include the corresponding widget command in your response. The command syntax is literal text you output—it gets parsed and replaced with an interactive widget.\n    55→\n    56→**When to include widgets:**\n    57→- User explicitly asks for a specific tool → ALWAYS include the widget\n    58→- User describes a craving or urge → Include W_DENTS or W_URGESURF\n    59→- User is rationalizing → Include W_TAPE\n    60→- User has a distorted thought → Include W_EVIDENCE\n    61→- User feels overwhelmed by circumstances → Include W_STOIC\n    62→\n    63→### DENTS Protocol (W_DENTS)\n    64→When someone is experiencing a craving, guide them through DENTS:\n    65→- **D**eny or Delay: Remind yourself the urge will pass\n    66→- **E**scape: Leave the trigger situation\n    67→- **N**eutralize: Challenge the internal monologue\n    68→- **T**asks: Redirect attention\n    69→- **S**wap: Change internal state\n    70→\n    71→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_DENTS|{\"trigger\":\"description\",\"intensity\":7}]\\`\n    72→\n    73→### Play the Tape Through (W_TAPE)\n    74→When rationalization begins, help trace the full chain of consequences.\n    75→\n    76→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_TAPE|{\"trigger\":\"description\",\"currentThought\":\"the thought\"}]\\`\n    77→\n    78→### CBT Evidence Examination (W_EVIDENCE)\n    79→Guide through examining cognitive distortions.\n    80→\n    81→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_EVIDENCE|{\"thought\":\"the thought\",\"distortion\":\"type\"}]\\`\n    82→\n    83→### Dichotomy of Control (W_STOIC)\n    84→Help distinguish between what's in their control and what isn't.\n    85→\n    86→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_STOIC|{\"situation\":\"description\"}]\\`\n    87→\n    88→### Urge Surfing (W_URGESURF)\n    89→Guided meditation for riding out urges.\n    90→\n    91→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_URGESURF|{\"duration\":300}]\\`\n    92→\n    93→### Daily Check-In (W_CHECKIN)\n    94→Track mood, habits, and sobriety for the day.\n    95→\n    96→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_CHECKIN|{}]\\`\n    97→\n    98→### Commitment Statement (W_COMMITMENT)\n    99→Review or edit the user's commitment statement.\n   100→\n   101→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_COMMITMENT|{\"mode\":\"view\"}]\\` or \\`[WIDGET:W_COMMITMENT|{\"mode\":\"edit\"}]\\`\n   102→\n   103→### Support Network (W_NETWORK)\n   104→View, contact, or edit support network.\n   105→\n   106→Use: \\`[WIDGET:W_NETWORK|{\"action\":\"view\"}]\\` or \\`[WIDGET:W_NETWORK|{\"action\":\"notify\"}]\\`\n   107→\n   108→## Conversational Approach\n   109→\n   110→### Tone\n   111→- **Warm but direct**: You care, and that includes being honest\n   112→- **Conversational**: Write in prose, not bullet points.

Here is my review.\n\n---\n\n# Code Review: Daily Memory Extraction System\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\nThe implementation is well-structured, closely follows the plan, and the typecheck passes cleanly. The core architecture -- login-triggered, non-blocking LLM extraction with encrypted persistence -- is sound. The code reads well, follows established patterns in the codebase, and the extraction prompt is thoughtfully designed.\n\nThat said, there are several issues that need attention, ranging from a critical security gap to moderate improvements.\n\n---\n\n## Critical Issues (Must Fix)\n\n### 1. `dailyMemories` table is missing from `changePassword`, `resetPasswordWithRecoveryPhrase`, `createVault`, backup/restore\n\n**Files affected:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/vault.ts`\n\nWhen a user changes their password (line 837-849) or resets via recovery phrase (line 994-1006), all encrypted tables are re-encrypted with the new key. The `dailyMemories` table is **not included** in either of these transaction blocks. This means:\n\n- After a password change, all daily memories become undecryptable (data loss).\n- The `createVault` function (line 82-93) also does not clear `db.dailyMemories`, meaning stale encrypted data from a previous vault could remain.\n- The `BackupData` interface (line 1121-1136) does not include `dailyMemories`, so backups and restores will lose all memory data.\n- The `exportEncryptedBackup` function (line 1259-1282) and `importBackup` function (line 1149-1257) also omit `dailyMemories`.\n\nThis is a data integrity and security concern. Every place that iterates over \"all tables\" needs to include `dailyMemories`.\n\n---\n\n## Important Issues (Should Fix)\n\n### 2. Race condition: concurrent extraction on rapid lock/unlock\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memoryExtraction.ts` (line 260)\n\n`runMemoryExtractionIfNeeded()` is called fire-and-forget on every unlock. If a user locks and unlocks rapidly (or the page refreshes), two extractions could run concurrently. Both would pass the `latest.date === todayStr` check before either has persisted its result, leading to duplicate memories.\n\nA simple guard would suffice:\n\n```typescript\nlet extractionInProgress = false\n\nexport async function runMemoryExtractionIfNeeded(): Promise<void> {\n  if (extractionInProgress) return\n  extractionInProgress = true\n  try {\n    // ... existing logic\n  } finally {\n    extractionInProgress = false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. `new Date(since)` timezone inconsistency in `gatherActivity`\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memoryExtraction.ts` (line 61)\n\n```typescript\nconst sinceTimestamp = new Date(since).getTime()\n```\n\nWhen `since` is a date-only string like `\"2026-02-20\"`, `new Date(\"2026-02-20\")` is parsed as **UTC midnight**, not local midnight. This means in timezones behind UTC (e.g., US timezones), the timestamp will be several hours into the previous day local time, potentially missing activity from the early hours of `since`. Meanwhile, `today()` in the codebase (line 676-678 of `types/index.ts`) uses `new Date()` which returns local time.\n\nThe fix is to parse the date as local:\n\n```typescript\nconst [year, month, day] = since.split('-').map(Number)\nconst sinceTimestamp = new Date(year, month - 1, day).getTime()\n```\n\n### 4. Chat message content is not truncated in the extraction prompt\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memoryExtraction.ts` (line 117-120)\n\nThe plan specified truncating message content to 500 characters (`m.content.slice(0, 500)`), but the implementation sends full message content:\n\n```typescript\nconst convoLines = activity.chatMessages.map(\n  m => `[${m.role}] ${m.content}`\n)\n```\n\nFor users with long conversations, this could easily blow past the Haiku context window (200K tokens is generous, but sending days of untruncated conversations is wasteful and increases cost). Consider adding truncation per the original plan, or at least capping total prompt size.\n\n### 5. No sorting of chat messages or journal entries before building the prompt\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memoryExtraction.ts` (lines 117-120, 127-129)\n\nThe plan specified `.sort((a, b) => a.timestamp - b.timestamp)` on both chat messages and journal entries. The implementation omits sorting. Chat messages come from `getChatHistory` which sorts by timestamp within a session, but across multiple sessions the order depends on the iteration order of `recentSessionIds`. Without explicit sorting, the LLM receives conversations in a potentially jumbled order, which could reduce extraction quality.\n\n---\n\n## Suggestions (Nice to Have)\n\n### 6. The `getDailyMemories` `after` filter logic may be counterintuitive\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/vault.ts` (line 681-682)\n\n```typescript\nquery = query.filter(m => m.date >= options.after!)\n```\n\nThe query is ordered by date **descending** (`.reverse()`), then filtered. Combined with `.limit()`, this means the limit is applied to the filtered results in reverse-date order, which is correct. However, the `after` parameter name suggests \"after this date\" but the implementation uses `>=` (inclusive). This matches how `getMetrics` works, so it is consistent, but worth noting.\n\n### 7. The `ExtractionResult` interface could benefit from validation\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memoryExtraction.ts` (lines 166-174, 219)\n\nThe `JSON.parse(text) as ExtractionResult` cast on line 219 is a type assertion with no runtime validation. If the LLM returns malformed JSON that parses but has wrong types (e.g., `userFacts` as a string instead of an array), the memory would be saved with corrupted data. The fallback on parse failure (lines 220-234) is good, but consider adding basic validation:\n\n```typescript\nif (!Array.isArray(result.userFacts)) result.userFacts = []\nif (!Array.isArray(result.followUps)) result.followUps = []\nif (!Array.isArray(result.notablePatterns)) result.notablePatterns = []\n```\n\n### 8. Singleton Anthropic client in memoryExtraction may cause issues if API key changes\n\n**File:** `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memoryExtraction.ts` (lines 21-43)\n\nThe `getClient()` function caches the Anthropic client in a module-level `let client`. This is fine for the current use case but differs from the plan which created a new client each time. The singleton pattern is actually an improvement (avoids recreating the client), so this deviation is beneficial.\n\n---\n\n## Plan Alignment Summary\n\n| Plan Task | Status | Notes |\n|-----------|--------|-------|\n| Task 1: DailyMemory type | Implemented correctly | Matches plan exactly |\n| Task 2: Database v5 migration | Implemented correctly | Matches plan exactly |\n| Task 3: Vault CRUD | Implemented correctly | Matches plan exactly |\n| Task 4: Memory extraction service | Implemented with minor deviations | Missing truncation, sorting; added JSON parse fallback (good); singleton client (good) |\n| Task 5: Login trigger | Implemented correctly | Fire-and-forget as planned |\n| Task 6: Orchestrator injection | Implemented correctly | Both greeting and chat contexts include memories |\n| Task 7: System prompt rendering | Implemented correctly | Daily notes section added; memory section matches plan |\n| Task 8: Remi prompt update | Implemented correctly | Accurately describes the persistent memory system |\n\nThe implementation faithfully follows the plan. The deviations are minor and the additions (JSON parse fallback, singleton client, explicit \"no data\" sections in the prompt) are improvements.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Action Items\n\n1. **[Critical]** Add `dailyMemories` to `changePassword`, `resetPasswordWithRecoveryPhrase`, `createVault`, `BackupData`, `exportEncryptedBackup`, and `importBackup` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/vault.ts`.\n2. **[Important]** Add a concurrency guard to `runMemoryExtractionIfNeeded()` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`.\n3. **[Important]** Fix timezone-aware date parsing in `gatherActivity()` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`.\n4. **[Important]** Add content truncation to the extraction prompt in `buildExtractionPrompt()` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`.\n5. **[Important]** Sort chat messages and journal entries by timestamp in `buildExtractionPrompt()`.\n6. **[Suggestion]** Add basic runtime validation of the LLM's JSON response before saving."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a17c67055f6f88032 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 83798\ntool_uses: 18\nduration_ms: 80088</usage>"}]}]},"uuid":"aed651a1-7a01-4e13-8f78-ad2666c11649","timestamp":"2026-02-22T11:38:11.966Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Review the daily memory extraction system implementation.\n\n## What was implemented\n\nA login-triggered, LLM-powered memory extraction system for RecoveryLM.

The deviations are minor and the additions (JSON parse fallback, singleton client, explicit \"no data\" sections in the prompt) are improvements.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Action Items\n\n1. **[Critical]** Add `dailyMemories` to `changePassword`, `resetPasswordWithRecoveryPhrase`, `createVault`, `BackupData`, `exportEncryptedBackup`, and `importBackup` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/vault.ts`.\n2. **[Important]** Add a concurrency guard to `runMemoryExtractionIfNeeded()` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`.\n3. **[Important]** Fix timezone-aware date parsing in `gatherActivity()` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`.\n4. **[Important]** Add content truncation to the extraction prompt in `buildExtractionPrompt()` in `/Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm/src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`.\n5. **[Important]** Sort chat messages and journal entries by timestamp in `buildExtractionPrompt()`.\n6. **[Suggestion]** Add basic runtime validation of the LLM's JSON response before saving."}],"totalDurationMs":80088,"totalTokens":83798,"totalToolUseCount":18,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":647,"cache_read_input_tokens":80827,"output_tokens":2323,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":647,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"fb18ec69-f782-47f0-94d5-90beb5629ccf"}

Add `db.dailyMemories` re-encryption following the same pattern as the other tables.\n\n2. **`resetPasswordWithRecoveryPhrase` function** — same as above, find the re-encryption loop and add `dailyMemories`.\n\n3. **`createVault` function** — if there's a clearing step that clears old tables, add `db.dailyMemories.clear()`.\n\n4. **`BackupData` interface** — add `dailyMemories` field (same pattern as other tables).\n\n5. **`exportEncryptedBackup` function** — add `dailyMemories` to the export.\n\n6. **`importBackup` function** — add `dailyMemories` to the import/restore.\n\nFor each of these, read the surrounding code to understand the exact pattern used and follow it precisely.\n\n## Fix 2 (Important): Add concurrency guard to runMemoryExtractionIfNeeded\n\n**File:** `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`\n\nAdd a module-level guard:\n\n```typescript\nlet extractionInProgress = false\n```\n\nAt the start of `runMemoryExtractionIfNeeded()`, add:\n```typescript\nif (extractionInProgress) return\nextractionInProgress = true\n```\n\nAnd wrap the try/catch in a finally that resets it:\n```typescript\n} finally {\n  extractionInProgress = false\n}\n```\n\n## Fix 3 (Important): Fix timezone-aware date parsing in gatherActivity\n\n**File:** `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`\n\nFind `const sinceTimestamp = new Date(since).getTime()` and replace with:\n\n```typescript\nconst [year, month, day] = since.split('-').map(Number)\nconst sinceTimestamp = new Date(year, month - 1, day).getTime()\n```\n\n## Fix 4 (Important): Add content truncation in buildExtractionPrompt\n\n**File:** `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`\n\nIn `buildExtractionPrompt`, truncate message content:\n- Chat messages: `.content.slice(0, 500)` \n- Journal entries: `.content.slice(0, 400)`\n\n## Fix 5 (Important): Sort chat messages and journal entries by timestamp\n\n**File:** `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`\n\nIn `buildExtractionPrompt`, sort before mapping:\n- Chat messages: `.sort((a, b) => a.timestamp - b.timestamp)`\n- Journal entries: `.sort((a, b) => a.timestamp - b.timestamp)`\n\n## Fix 6 (Suggestion): Add basic validation of LLM JSON response\n\n**File:** `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`\n\nAfter `JSON.parse(text)`, add validation:\n```typescript\nif (!Array.isArray(result.userFacts)) result.userFacts = []\nif (!Array.isArray(result.followUps)) result.followUps = []\nif (!Array.isArray(result.notablePatterns)) result.notablePatterns = []\nif (typeof result.emotionalState !== 'string') result.emotionalState = 'Unknown'\n```\n\n## After all fixes\n\nRun: `npm run typecheck`\nThen commit all changes:\n```bash\ngit add -A && git commit -m \"fix(memory): address code review issues in vault integration and extraction service\"\n```\n\nWork from: /Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm","agentId":"af7f909a8a7d7ccdf"},"toolUseID":"agent_msg_01VCKDRFyYNxoJ4GuZFX1Wky","parentToolUseID":"toolu_01VFKDGeHGU5c8PZrWRhpVnc","uuid":"29a2eefb-8b7f-47b7-8f57-7eb702c6526e","timestamp":"2026-02-22T11:39:01.079Z"}

Add `dailyMemories` to each. Specifically:\n\n1. **`changePassword` function** — find the transaction block that re-encrypts all tables. Add `db.dailyMemories` re-encryption following the same pattern as the other tables.\n\n2. **`resetPasswordWithRecoveryPhrase` function** — same as above, find the re-encryption loop and add `dailyMemories`.\n\n3. **`createVault` function** — if there's a clearing step that clears old tables, add `db.dailyMemories.clear()`.\n\n4. **`BackupData` interface** — add `dailyMemories` field (same pattern as other tables).\n\n5. **`exportEncryptedBackup` function** — add `dailyMemories` to the export.\n\n6. **`importBackup` function** — add `dailyMemories` to the import/restore.\n\nFor each of these, read the surrounding code to understand the exact pattern used and follow it precisely.\n\n## Fix 2 (Important): Add concurrency guard to runMemoryExtractionIfNeeded\n\n**File:** `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`\n\nAdd a module-level guard:\n\n```typescript\nlet extractionInProgress = false\n```\n\nAt the start of `runMemoryExtractionIfNeeded()`, add:\n```typescript\nif (extractionInProgress) return\nextractionInProgress = true\n```\n\nAnd wrap the try/catch in a finally that resets it:\n```typescript\n} finally {\n  extractionInProgress = false\n}\n```\n\n## Fix 3 (Important): Fix timezone-aware date parsing in gatherActivity\n\n**File:** `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`\n\nFind `const sinceTimestamp = new Date(since).getTime()` and replace with:\n\n```typescript\nconst [year, month, day] = since.split('-').map(Number)\nconst sinceTimestamp = new Date(year, month - 1, day).getTime()\n```\n\n## Fix 4 (Important): Add content truncation in buildExtractionPrompt\n\n**File:** `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`\n\nIn `buildExtractionPrompt`, truncate message content:\n- Chat messages: `.content.slice(0, 500)` \n- Journal entries: `.content.slice(0, 400)`\n\n## Fix 5 (Important): Sort chat messages and journal entries by timestamp\n\n**File:** `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`\n\nIn `buildExtractionPrompt`, sort before mapping:\n- Chat messages: `.sort((a, b) => a.timestamp - b.timestamp)`\n- Journal entries: `.sort((a, b) => a.timestamp - b.timestamp)`\n\n## Fix 6 (Suggestion): Add basic validation of LLM JSON response\n\n**File:** `src/services/memoryExtraction.ts`\n\nAfter `JSON.parse(text)`, add validation:\n```typescript\nif (!Array.isArray(result.userFacts)) result.userFacts = []\nif (!Array.isArray(result.followUps)) result.followUps = []\nif (!Array.isArray(result.notablePatterns)) result.notablePatterns = []\nif (typeof result.emotionalState !== 'string') result.emotionalState = 'Unknown'\n```\n\n## After all fixes\n\nRun: `npm run typecheck`\nThen commit all changes:\n```bash\ngit add -A && git commit -m \"fix(memory): address code review issues in vault integration and extraction service\"\n```\n\nWork from: /Users/fieldbradley/Projects/recoverylm","agentId":"af7f909a8a7d7ccdf","content":[{"type":"text","text":"All fixes have been applied and committed.

User unlocks vault → `runMemoryExtractionIfNeeded()` fires async\n2. Checks last `DailyMemory` date — if before today, gathers all activity since then\n3. Sends conversations, journal entries, and metrics to Claude Haiku with extraction prompt\n4. Haiku returns structured JSON: facts, summaries, follow-ups, emotional state, patterns\n5. Result encrypted and stored as `DailyMemory` in vault\n6. On every chat (greeting or message), orchestrator loads memories into context\n7. System prompt renders \"What You Know About This User\" section for Remi\n\nWould you like to push this branch or create a PR?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":549,"cache_read_input_tokens":109440,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":549},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYP3XqgRjX5kcdJeQK3C2","type":"assistant","uuid":"d21fee8e-a321-4d5e-a3c8-98fd58b8dcea","timestamp":"2026-02-22T11:40:39.894Z"}

The ActivitiesPage initializes `currentMetrics` with `moodScore: 5` as default.

The extraction correctly reported what was in the vault. But the **extraction prompt should be smarter** about this — it shouldn't treat a default mood score of 5 as a real data point.\n\nHowever, the real question is: does the user's Feb 22 metric actually exist in the vault with `moodScore: 5`? If so, the extraction is faithfully reporting it. The bug is in the check-in auto-save, not the extraction.\n\nFor the extraction service, the pragmatic fix is to not report mood scores of exactly 5 unless the user has also filled in other optional fields (sleep, anxiety, cravings, notes) — indicating they actively did a check-in rather than just toggling a habit.\n\nBut this is a band-aid.

That means it's hitting one of the early return paths silently. Let me check - it could be:\n\n1. `latest.date === todayStr` - already extracted today (but user says table is empty)\n2. `coveringFrom >= todayStr` - covering period starts today\n\nWait, the user already had a successful extraction earlier (that had the JSON parsing issue). After we fixed the parsing, did the extraction actually save? Let me think...\n\nActually, the first time the extraction ran, it failed with the streaming error. Then it failed with JSON parsing. Each time, the `extractionInProgress` flag gets reset in the finally block. \n\nBut did a memory actually get saved at any point? The user said the table is empty - so no memory was ever saved successfully. So `latest` is null, and we go to the profile.createdAt path. But the user said \"no errors\" this time, which means the function is returning early silently. I need to trace through the logic - if `latest` is null, we shouldn't hit that first return, so it must be the `coveringFrom >= todayStr` check that's stopping it.\n\nIf the user's account was created today, then createdAt would be today's date, making coveringFrom equal to today's date string. That would trigger the early return and explain why nothing happens but no error is thrown.\n\nBut wait—the user reported this issue on Day 2, so their account should've been created before today. Unless createdAt got reset somehow, or the profile is null and we're hitting an unexpected code path.

But it says \"You've got a day behind you\" which implies Day 1, when the user is actually on Day 70+. \n\nThis is the sobriety date bug we fixed earlier in the onboarding. The user onboarded before our fix, so their `sobrietyStartDate` in the vault is still set to the day they signed up (yesterday or whenever), not 70 days ago. The fix only applies to new onboarding flows.\n\nThe existing user's profile still has the old incorrect `sobrietyStartDate`. We need to either:\n\n\n1. Have the user update their sobriety date in settings\n2. Or update it programmatically\n\nThe memory extraction correctly pulled \"70+ days sober (71 days as of Feb 22)\" as a user fact, so Remi has that context. But the `temporalContext.daysSober` still shows 1-2 days because it's computed from the wrong stored `sobrietyStartDate`. The greeting instruction uses that computed value, so Remi gets conflicting signals — the greeting says a small number while the memory facts say 70+.\n\nThis mismatch happened because the user's profile was created before the sobriety date fix, so their vault still has an incorrect `sobrietyStartDate`. I need to surface this issue and give the user a way to correct it.","signature":"EvwMCkYICxgCKkBYJoI3/gpNWCz00uf0WJawEwktVj5GJuU3ph1kk75acSqElEhlaOhKiCanjcveWSWyuzwZWY02zRJgPTh5IVu2EgywHH7CaksXfI/6N9saDAO8QZFIocePAOWc9yIwLsR0AN+ztUFykQRpqmJ+ifqJ9GpudIcveQRXFFhUpO/8TktRA5EhTT5m4Tne/s8RKuMLyRScEFLd8mjOy+QY5XfvrgF29SImcF2AGA2c9r5Ij1mcLpNgpJ5TXm9/fYrisGelC8GAJAeQxJ672zkWk6YvP04GNaH4+J/BXyXYOCq4DiwDUW+JyP1z/0puOTUs56y/EqahpKoOhf2rSeFCrWT0iz3QROZF/rAL75mqIwPbnNYlgdIQc6bXpPBqWwtJCbaLeQjDKy0wqyAKZ7Y4xPNQ1lr97fN8Vz0AuYzwfA4xjUmquMx+AgGONgYiaL68U6h0wMEaJs/XIBWVqt96IGMuFKks83DVMoS+vTgSm+6/faZ5wDBucXxh0irlteHUTcfBKc5c+LUI3w1f2PZHQqyQx47pPjlewgyhVY4027qT88NFAcmqORuZ7Ins5ct24z/ayppQzYKHGcJi4rdbt1TgVjqg1v22A9nja/Fq0mEl7+IvCFl+cs4FCy3wkRHeJjLnx3zBN26CsG9HDzo0swyTIc+jv05yyTUBB1EhVrtkaR7xyB0bY7hrJVrL9omZrmfRe4wmX8lOSMSY+gfleEM3Wya12bbO6NZ+AF8axUpinUILs8TA7Fks4D/XG+SmuDd80diPFW7e1hrcmG/zSqT17BdiKshz1iyf3IMPrnIBFAorDZyF/b43OoTmGyK8wO6DWk/SITuN9CTp/eUvH4A12QhJtfbo+dc2mJTPfUpvcmbbK/B60g2FSsXGeTeBhLqul/dIPVMd9Sh8t6ijF07rmM1wqZjbkpXNPKbif2uIq0yCw6GztvaLH95du20O8Z1k0O8DuCU1laXaGVwPMe+MG7/p2W3SkqJeTVXOqgxqusvcU5Odrl5XZXvsZJIzjwROMT6Lu52TwfM+MT8ttvXQCBRHn7mQ7uMBi9x1OPKmx3RCF2O0uP05QYGf+9VKlqryGqjO1qCrvR98N/CLfTzkY0l3Ten5DTHgL/kMN/oJfqmO8IuaaR5+KR/KPiHsI6Y9smIS5xhTiUgD+GLg37CjQ4FO0KQArJK6fGX4vlY8WFIU6twNU5rE3zUWuKDzz237wcE+76wEgAwC83H7TSM1MbUpRrKW22uPFIowQByUuaUxTj7clGxHUDfOrQuIfAKQwJd7e3IR1i9tDwJYl97+IzdiTH0bHIr9ijEvOC2B+m/woSHM4cyDy/mpqHICyaF/B/iGxQhOC9K/bli9oFCzki/HGtzJVz3ZbHzSFJmd8yWyCBlbOlEOB7nvrCsIOBYuDYsXHe5HLr3K+fjO4mW4PSeXXR0ruLZ0opzWCf5TyGk+m42Hr2s21mcJCIwC8vW+VoXtdxCguHnOAmKyx0sE9KunEr4crJ1TQKfMiQD8JFEICl4V1OBlxtZ2xyC18k6ykkESY1jNGbB+TmSxdisDbqZURQbIn0TdPQopeLzrfsuE0RRhcb0idHRt6wrTq/6TPVkBsAyK+sywicD/qrJRXH/SekHe4nq/6Koiz9iOJOcp1KM6cbO/BLMOfM5G2sUvSbGwHEtuzMLIUdtOLYYEs6DVyj/voSuEdIykuGcc7RoAM6ec8BdaPlnCkqOw9p9xdrHpiQCjB9ocp0PSqCIqbd6Pw/NaQBDKwslffS9tB8rm+d2F5Qpy7YBpLkyUMG6VB5KH8Oeh6bqCDUQFHO66DJoJnsm5TWhV47ntw1iZFOnWlZEOPF0PucRTy99G03vs5ptjOkpy5vk3Gkx/FstVRVapzg+OhULLmPVwCTD/Tcnc6p/YjnA8b4AbqOKVXAwN4FEw0O0wS5GwRyL4Pxq9S1xijy2XXU7UuOisun+pIh9JjZ0zEgItugMX1VLLrSYYQHge7kqROZ8vg0BnDudW0OkdpLbKTpArfeefatbRPox3zkMGmaR4UKk+6mXEWyDst/DpJWe7mHqbkZkqhJjiwThlaeI8fCPCMbqpHxyTMRiaLBrMWx1ptX6r81itHuNfyLHAERQaCs2LI9Y54wtNpcBumBHVmV9LTpEHC0j05bBe28Nf+lS8EeGvM2LMBFJWwZ8Q6jCatQQ2fw/2LYui6/JsYRgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1666,"cache_read_input_tokens":134924,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1666},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYP4v1vYqoU9u4mWdFRcx","type":"assistant","uuid":"54cfdebc-7e79-4ea6-9959-5d0784764e2b","timestamp":"2026-02-22T11:58:49.932Z"}

Memory user fact: \"70+ days sober (71 days as of Feb 22)\"\n\nThe greeting instruction explicitly says `Days sober: 1` which directly contradicts the memory. Remi is going with the system data over the memory.\n\n\nThe real problem is that the hardcoded temporal context in the system prompt and greeting instruction is overriding the memory facts. The fix would be to either have the memory extraction update the profile's sobrietyStartDate, or give the extracted memory facts higher priority than the stale profile data when there's a conflict. of the 70 days - and it does, but the temporal context contradicts it. The temporal context is computed from the wrong profile data.\n\nThe cleanest fix is to update the profile's sobrietyStartDate based on what the memory extraction learned. We could do this in the extraction service - if a user fact mentions sobriety days, compute and update the profile's sobrietyStartDate.\n\nBut that's fragile (parsing LLM output to update profile). A simpler approach: in the greeting instruction and system prompt, when memory user facts are available, either omit the computed \"Days sober\" or add a note that the memory facts should take precedence.\n\nActually, the simplest fix right now: just make the memory facts more prominent in the greeting instruction, and add a note that if there's a conflict between computed days and user-reported days, trust the user's own report.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":31,"cache_read_input_tokens":137182,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":31},"output_tokens":5,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYP4zCPxLN4UbU1aK1iP2","type":"assistant","uuid":"767468a8-505d-4ee0-b076-5fa42aca4f9c","timestamp":"2026-02-22T11:59:51.060Z"}

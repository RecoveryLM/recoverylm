# Self-Intervention Recovery Framework

A self-directed approach to addiction recovery that puts you in charge of your own intervention.

---

## Overview

Traditional interventions are done *to* someone. This framework inverts that: you lead your own intervention, asking the people you trust most to help you stay accountable.

This approach works for people who:

- Want evidence-based, secular recovery methods
- Prefer structure and systems over willpower alone
- Recognize they need external accountability
- Are willing to be vulnerable and ask for help

---

## The Three Pillars

Recovery built on a single support is fragile. This framework uses three pillars so that if one wobbles, the others hold.

### 1. Therapeutic Work

Choose at least one of the following. Both is ideal, but one committed practice is better than two half-hearted ones.

#### Option A: Individual Therapy

Work with a therapist who specializes in addiction. This provides:

- Expert guidance tailored to your specific patterns
- A confidential space to process difficult material
- Professional tools (CBT, motivational interviewing, etc.)
- Continuity across the ups and downs

Weekly sessions are recommended, especially in early recovery.

#### Option B: Recovery Program

Choose an evidence-based program that fits your philosophy:

##### SMART Recovery

- Science-based, secular approach
- Uses cognitive-behavioral techniques
- Focuses on self-empowerment, not powerlessness
- Builds motivation, coping skills, thought management, and life balance
- Offers meetings for both individuals and family/friends

##### Recovery Dharma

- Buddhist-inspired, meditation-focused approach
- Emphasizes mindfulness and the Four Noble Truths applied to addiction
- Non-theistic and inclusive
- Strong community orientation

Other options include 12-step programs, Refuge Recovery, LifeRing, or other structured approaches. The key is consistent participation, whether with a therapist or in a recovery community.

### 2. Personal Accountability Network

This is where the self-intervention framework is distinctive. You build a structured support network with defined roles, clear expectations, and explicit authority to intervene. (See "Building Your Accountability Network" below.)

### 3. Daily Practice

Structure and habits that support recovery every day:

- Consistent daily schedule
- Tracked metrics (sobriety, exercise, meditation, study, etc.)
- Cognitive work (CBT, Stoic reflection)
- Distress tolerance skills
- Regular connection with supportive people

The daily practice fills the space that substances used to occupy.

## Building Your Accountability Network

### The Self-Intervention Meeting

Gather trusted friends and family to formally launch your recovery. You control this.

#### What you say
>
> "I called you here because I trust you, and I need help. I'm starting recovery with structure: therapy, a recovery program, and a support network I've designed. But I can't do it alone. I'm asking you to be part of my accountability. Here's what I've built, what I'm asking of you, and how you can help me stay on track."

Then walk through your framework, metrics, support roles, and response protocols.

### Support Network Tiers

#### Tier 1: Core Support (Daily/Weekly Contact)

- People who will check in regularly
- Know your full situation
- Have explicit authority to intervene
- Ideally includes at least one person in recovery themselves

#### Tier 2: Extended Support

- Aware of your recovery
- Available if Tier 1 needs backup
- Provide community witness and encouragement

#### Tier 3: Not Included

- People where the relationship is complicated (boss, family with poor boundaries, etc.)
- Those you're protecting from worry
- Acquaintances who don't need to know

### Primary Support Partner

Designate one person as your primary accountability partner. This person:

- Checks in daily or near-daily
- Monitors your progress metrics
- Has authority to ask hard questions
- Initiates escalation when warning signs appear

Choose someone who is reliable, can handle difficult conversations, and won't enable you. A partner/spouse can fill this role but may need backup support given the emotional complexity.

### Backup Support Partner

Your primary partner will have constraints (work, family, emotional capacity). Designate a backup who:

- Shares the accountability load
- Is available when the primary isn't
- Provides a second perspective
- Can confer with the primary on concerns

---

## Daily Structure and Metrics

### Why Structure Matters

Addiction thrives in chaos. Structure creates predictability, reduces decision fatigue, and builds momentum through small daily wins. When you're not using, routine and discipline create a sense of control and progress.

### Recommended Daily Habits

Track these daily (app, whiteboard, or journal):

- **Sobriety**: Running count of days
- **Exercise**: Physical activity builds mood stability and stress tolerance
- **Meditation/Mindfulness**: Builds the pause between stimulus and response
- **Study/Learning**: Engages your mind constructively
- **Healthy Eating**: Physical health supports mental health
- **Connection**: Time with supportive people

### Tracking Methods

#### Streak Counting

Track both positive streaks (days doing the habit) and negative streaks (days missed). Negative streaks are leading indicators. Three days without exercise might signal something is off before actual relapse.

#### Recommended Tools

- Habit tracking apps (Streaks, Habitica, etc.)
- Physical whiteboard (visible, visceral)
- Weekly updates shared with support network

### Sample Daily Schedule

```text
5:30 AM    Wake, light therapy (if applicable)
Morning    Study/learning block (60-90 min)
           Exercise
           Meditation
Daytime    Work (structured, with breaks)
Evening    Connection time (partner, friends, family)
           Light study or creative work
           CBT/recovery reflection
           Wind-down routine
           Reading before sleep
```

Maintain the same schedule on weekends. Consistency reinforces the structure.

## Cognitive and Emotional Tools

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

CBT helps you catch and examine automatic thoughts before they drive behavior. Key practices:

#### Identify Cognitive Distortions

- All-or-nothing thinking ("I slipped once, so I've failed completely")
- Catastrophizing ("This craving will never end")
- Mind reading ("Everyone thinks I'm weak")
- Fortune telling ("I'll never be able to quit")

#### Practice the Evidence Test

When a negative thought arises:

1. What's the thought?
2. What's the actual evidence for it?
3. What's the evidence against it?
4. What's a more balanced view?

#### Resources

- *The CBT Workbook* or similar guided workbook
- Clarity app for daily CBT training
- Substance-specific workbooks from your therapist

### Stoic Philosophy (Optional but Recommended)

Stoicism pairs well with CBT. Both focus on the space between stimulus and response.

#### The Dichotomy of Control

Distinguish between what's fully in your control (your judgments, intentions, actions), partially in your control (outcomes you can influence), and outside your control (external events, others' reactions).

#### The Impression-to-Assent Gap

You can't control what thoughts or urges arise. You *can* control whether you assent to them. Practice noticing impressions without automatically acting on them.

#### Resources

- *Handbook for New Stoics* (52-week guided practice)
- *Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius
- *Discourses* by Epictetus

### AI as Recovery Companion

An AI assistant like Claude can serve as a valuable extension of your recovery support system. It fills gaps and deepens the work.

#### Setting Up

Create a Claude Project dedicated to your recovery. Add your recovery plan document to the project files. This gives Claude persistent context about your framework, your specific vulnerabilities, and your approach.

#### Daily Use

- **Logging thoughts**: When automatic thoughts arise, talk them through with Claude. Articulating a thought to someone else forces you past the surface-level reaction.
- **CBT practice**: Work through cognitive distortions in real-time. Claude can ask "what's the evidence for that thought?" and help you examine alternatives.
- **Stoic reflection**: Go deeper with workbook exercises. Rather than just listing what's in your control, explore the nuances in dialogue.
- **Urge processing**: When an urge hits, use Claude to work through DENTS or play the tape through. Sometimes you need to externalize the process.
- **Session prep**: Before therapy, review the week with Claude to organize your thoughts and identify what's worth discussing.

#### Pattern Recognition

Claude tracks across conversations within a project. Over time, it can surface patterns you might not notice yourself: recurring triggers, cognitive distortions that show up repeatedly, times of day when you're most vulnerable. This creates a kind of extended memory for your recovery work.

#### What It's Good For

- Available 24/7 when human support isn't
- Non-judgmental space to process difficult thoughts
- Forcing function for articulating and examining your thinking
- Systematic approach to CBT and philosophical exercises
- Preparation for therapy sessions
- Continuity across weeks and months of recovery work

#### What It's Not

- Not a replacement for human connection
- Not a substitute for professional therapy
- Not someone who can show up at your door when you're in crisis
- Not infallible

Use it as an extension of your support system, not the foundation of it.

### Urge Management: The DENTS Protocol

DENTS is a SMART Recovery tool for managing urges in the moment:

- **Deny or Delay**: Remind yourself the urge will pass. Refuse to give in, even one moment at a time.
- **Escape**: If you know the trigger, leave immediately. Exit the place, conversation, or situation.
- **Neutralize**: Challenge your internal monologue. "This urge will kill me" becomes "This urge will pass."
- **Tasks**: Redirect attention with an activity that occupies mind and body.
- **Swap**: Change your internal state. Go somewhere, do something, connect with someone.

### Play the Tape Through

When rationalization starts, don't stop at the momentary relief. Trace the full chain:

1. "Just one drink/hit/use"
2. â†’ Impaired judgment
3. â†’ Escalation ("one more won't hurt")
4. â†’ Full relapse
5. â†’ Lying to support network
6. â†’ Damage to relationships, self-respect, progress
7. â†’ Starting over from zero

Play the tape all the way to the consequences. The momentary relief isn't worth the full cost.

## Understanding Your Vulnerability Pattern

Not everyone's risk profile is the same. Understanding yours shapes your prevention strategy.

### The Craving Pattern

Some people struggle primarily with acute cravings, intense urges that demand immediate relief. If this is you:

- Focus on urge surfing and distress tolerance
- Build a robust toolkit for riding out the 30-60 minute wave
- Medication (like GLP-1 agonists for some substances) may help

### The Rationalization Pattern

Others handle acute cravings well but are vulnerable to rationalization during stable periods. The danger is "I've earned this" or "I've proven I can control it."

If this is you:

- Your highest risk is when things are going *well*
- Watch for thoughts like:
  - "I've proven I can quit. I'm in control now."
  - "I've been so disciplined. I deserve this."
  - "I'll just use occasionally, not like before."
  - "The insight/creativity was valuable."
- Build defenses specifically against persuasive internal arguments

### Seemingly Irrelevant Decisions

Rationalization rarely arrives as a single moment. It's a chain of small permissions that feel reasonable in isolation:

- Spending time at a trigger location "just to see a friend"
- Skipping a recovery meeting because "things are going well"
- Letting accountability check-ins lapse
- Deciding the structure was for early days, not now

Each decision seems harmless. The chain leads somewhere. Learn to recognize yours.

---

## External Accountability Structures

### Location Sharing

Share your location with your primary support partner using apps like Life360 or phone-native sharing. This provides:

- Automatic accountability without active check-ins
- Early warning if you visit trigger locations
- Removes the temptation to lie about where you've been

This is a constraint you build while clear-headed to support your future self.

### Voluntary Testing

Offer voluntary drug testing as a self-imposed pressure structure. Your support partners can request a test at any time. This:

- Adds weight to your commitment
- Provides objective verification during uncertain periods
- Removes "did they or didn't they" ambiguity

You pay for the tests. You've granted permission in advance. The logistics: go to a testing facility or use at-home tests with witnessed results.

### Detection Responsibility

Critical design principle: **Don't rely on self-reporting.**

Many people in recovery don't self-report relapse until after the fact, sometimes long after. The accountability system must assume concealment is possible and design around it.

Detection is the responsibility of support partners. They should:

- Watch leading indicators actively
- Not wait for admission that something is wrong
- Act on patterns, not just confessions
- Have explicit authority to verify (tests, showing up, etc.)

---

## Leading and Lagging Indicators

### Leading Indicators (Early Warning Signs)

These signal that something may be off *before* relapse:

- Multiple consecutive days without exercise
- Skipping meditation or recovery practices
- Isolating / not responding to messages
- Avoiding scheduled check-ins
- Spending time at known trigger locations
- Sudden mood shifts or defensiveness
- Breaking routine without explanation
- Letting metrics tracking lapse

**Key insight:** Intervene on leading indicators. That's prevention. Acting only on lagging indicators is response after the fact.

### Lagging Indicators

These confirm that relapse has occurred:

- Actual use (confirmed or suspected)
- Failed drug test

By the time you're seeing lagging indicators, you're in response mode, not prevention mode.

---

## Escalation Protocol

Define automatic responses tied to specific patterns. These tripwires don't require your input to activate. You've agreed to them in advance.

### Escalation Triggers

| Trigger | Response |
|---------|----------|
| 3+ days of missed key habits | Partners confer, reach out |
| Avoiding check-ins or being evasive | Direct conversation, increased contact |
| Suspected or confirmed use | Group response initiated |

### Response Protocol

#### For leading indicators

1. Support partners confer
2. Increased check-in frequency
3. Direct conversation
4. Adjust support structure as needed

#### For suspected or confirmed relapse

1. Partners confer, loop in broader network as appropriate
2. Intervene with support, not shame
3. Options: conversation, emergency meeting, increased presence, adjusted structure
4. Goal is course-correction, not punishment

### Granted Authority

Give your support partners explicit, standing authority to:

- Show up unannounced
- Ask hard questions and expect honest answers
- Request drug testing at any time
- Call a group response without your prior approval
- Escalate concerns to the broader support network
- Act on suspicion, not just confirmation

This authority is granted in advance. It does not require your permission in the moment.

---

## Building Emotional Resilience

Recovery requires building the capacity to handle life without substances.

### Distress Tolerance Tools

Build a toolkit of options for different contexts:

- **Cold water/dive reflex**: Cold water on face activates parasympathetic response
- **Box breathing**: 4 counts in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold
- **Progressive muscle relaxation**: Systematic tension and release
- **TIPP skills**: Temperature, Intense exercise, Paced breathing, Paired muscle relaxation
- **Urge surfing**: Observe the urge without acting, let it crest and pass

### Sitting with Discomfort

When a difficult emotion arises and it's not a crisis, practice staying with it for 2-3 minutes before using any coping technique. Name it, locate it in your body, describe its qualities. This builds capacity. You're training yourself that emotions are survivable without numbing or escaping.

### Non-Goal Positive Experiences

Schedule pleasurable activities that aren't tied to metrics or self-improvement. Things done purely because they feel good. This counters the intensity that can make recovery feel like deprivation.

### Reward Structure

What's the reward at the end of a hard day when "you've earned this" shows up?

- Schedule regular breaks (a night off per week from study/work)
- Reframe meditation from chore to reward: "this is my time to stop"
- Build in genuine pleasures that aren't goal-directed
- Recognize progress without requiring perfection

---

## Your Personal Commitment

Write your own commitment statement. Include:

#### What you're committing to

- Honesty with your support network
- Tracking your metrics daily
- Attending recovery program meetings
- Following therapeutic guidance
- Allowing intervention when you show warning signs

#### What you're letting go of

- Using past insight or creativity from substance use as justification for future use
- The belief that you can control or moderate
- The expectation that willpower alone will be enough

#### Why this matters to you

- Name the specific people you don't want to let down
- Name the future you're building toward
- Name what substances cost you

---

## Final Note

This framework is built on a simple insight: you can use your current clarity to constrain your future self. You're engineering for the reality that willpower alone isn't enough.

The structure makes recovery more likely. That's all it does.

You're choosing this. That's what makes it yours.
